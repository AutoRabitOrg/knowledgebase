## Instance Upgrade Requests

### Introduction

To ensure a smooth update process for your Instance, please follow the steps below to request a scheduled downtime with our support team.

### Overview

When a code change has successfully passed Quality Assurance (QA) and is ready for deployment, the support team will notify you through an existing support ticket, if applicable.

If you review the Release notes and decide to upgrade your Instance, please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) directly or send an email to the Support team with the downtime slots, as instructed below.\
