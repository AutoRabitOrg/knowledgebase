### Restore/Replicate

#### **CANNOT\_INSERT\_UPDATE\_ACTIVATE\_ENTITY**

This error is a result of an issue stemming from a trigger in the Org.

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Click on Replicate/restore job summary-> Click on Failure records-> download details-> view error in the 'Error' column.

#### DUPLICATE\_VALUE

Such failures occurs when such records are already present in the destination

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Click on Replicate job summary-> Click on Failure records-> download details-> view error in 'Error' column.
2. An existing automation is blocking the upsert operation. Try disabling the automation if necessary.
3. If you would like Vault to recognize the existing records in the destination that are created/transferred outside of Vault, you can configure the unique identifier for the object and enable the option ‘Prevent duplicate record creation using unique identifiers in replicate job config to avoid Vault from attempting to recreate an existing record matching the value in the unique identifier specified.
4. For steps on how to configure unique identifiers, go to this link:

* **Details**: Only feed items manually added by users to the chatter feed can be restored.
* **Error Message**: Attempting to restore system-generated chatter-feed items will result in the error: "Required field missing: Body."

#### **Restoration of Shared Objects Data**

* **Issue**: Salesforce does not permit the restoration of data in shared objects generated by sharing rules.
* **Details**: Only manually added share-related records in the shared object can be restored.

#### **Installed Packages**

* **MuleSoft** operates as an installed package component in Salesforce. Consequently, it cannot be backed up, restored, or replicated using API calls.&#x20;
* Installed packages, which includes **MuleSoft** or anything related to Mule, cannot be backed up directly; they must be obtained from the Salesforce AppExchange platform and installed.

**File Size Limits**

* **Issue:** If the metadata zip file exceeds the **file size limit of 39 MB**, then Vault cannot restore the file to the destination Org.&#x20;
* **Details**: Use the workbench to restore larger files.&#x20;
* **Error Message in the UI logs**: "Metadata ZIP file exceeds the maximum allowed size of 39 MB. Please refer to the  [AutoRABIT Knowledge Base](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/) for more details.”&#x20;
