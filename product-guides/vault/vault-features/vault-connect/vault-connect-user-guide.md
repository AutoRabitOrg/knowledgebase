# Vault Connect User Guide

### Introduction

This document provides complete information about the new feature Vault Connect, which will enhance the user‚Äôs capability to better utilize Vault in viewing archived Salesforce data from an external data source.

### Feature Overview

1. OData protocol is an open and platform-independent protocol that can be integrated with the system of the user‚Äôs choice (along with Salesforce) as it exposes REST APIs for consuming and querying data from the underlying archives.
2. External objects support most of the capabilities that standard and custom objects have in Salesforce.
3. No need to install any managed packages or write custom scripts in Salesforce.

### Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

Salesforce Connect OData 4.0 license subscription.

**Note:** Not required for free developer edition org

### Limitations <a href="#limitations" id="limitations"></a>

1. Files and attachments are not supported for viewing through external objects in Salesforce. This will be supported in the upcoming version of Vault Connect scheduled for the end of Q4‚Äô23.
2. Salesforce OData 4.0 adapter has a limitation on the number of callouts per hour. This will be addressed with the support for the Salesforce OData 4.01 adapter in subsequent versions of the capability.
3. Relationships between external objects and Salesforce objects need to be established manually (like if cases are archived and they are related to accounts that are not archived, the reference to accounts that are in the Salesforce object will be available in the external object but will not be reflected as a lookup relationship). The plan is to support the automated recreation of these references by the end of Q4 2023.
4. All the limitations of Salesforce external objects are applicable as mentioned in this article: [Help and Training Community](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en\_US\&id=sf.platform\_connect\_general\_limits.htm\&type=5)
5. The solution only supports customers configured with AWS S3 as a storage option in Vault.
6. There is a max limit of 5GB of archived data per customer supported for connecting to Salesforce external data source as part of the beta program. This can be extended to a higher limit by raising a request with [support@autorabit.com](mailto:support@autorabit.com).
7. Fields of type XmlObjectWrapper are not supported.
8.  Fields of the object that have soapType as double, values will be truncated according to the precision and scale, as defined in the metadata of the object‚Äôs field.

    **For example:** If a field holds decimal value information for that object, precision and scale values will be predefined.

    **Precision:** The maximum number of digits in a numeric value includes all numbers to the left and to the right of the decimal point (but excludes the decimal point character).

    **Scale:** The number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a numeric value must be less than the precision value.

**Example 1:**\
Define a custom number field, e.g., "Number." Give it length = 3 and decimal places = 1 (scale). It might seem that this is done to restrict the precision of the field to one decimal place. However, on the UI level (on a standard edit page), if you try to type in 237.631, here, precision is 4 and scale is 1. When mapping it back to Salesforce as the external object‚Äôs field, the value will be truncated to 237.6.\


**Example 2:**\
Say a field holds info on geolocation latitude and longitude and their precision and scale are 5 and 2, respectively. Let the value it holds be 77.2090, then when mapping it back to Salesforce as the external object‚Äôs field, it will be truncated to 77.20.
