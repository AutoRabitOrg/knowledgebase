# License is not valid

## Error message: License is not valid

#### Why am I getting the "License is not valid" error when trying to use CodeScan as the analysis tool while running a CI job in ARM? <a href="#id-15-why-am-i-getting-the-license-is-not-valid-error-when-trying-to-use-codescan-as-the-analysis-tool" id="id-15-why-am-i-getting-the-license-is-not-valid-error-when-trying-to-use-codescan-as-the-analysis-tool"></a>

This could be due to using an older version of CodeScan. Refer to the [CodeScan License Errors](../../../../codescan/codescan-faqs/codescan-self-hosted-issues/license-errors.md) article for further information.
