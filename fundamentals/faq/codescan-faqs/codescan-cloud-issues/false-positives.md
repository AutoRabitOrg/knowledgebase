# False Positives

### Can the status of issues marked as False Positives in the lower environment be transferred when the scan is triggered in the higher Environment?

Issues in standalone branches are treated separately. The status can only be transferred if the Develop branch is a comparison or pull request branch using ProductionReady as the target.
