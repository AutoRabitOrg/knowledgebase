Yes, you can reinstall CodeScan Self-Hosted and continue to utilize your existing license.

After you've set up the prerequisites, you can use your existing account and password to log into SonarQube. If it doesn't work, try logging in with the admin username and password.

1. Login into SonarQube using the below credentials:
   * **username:** _admin_
   * **password:** _admin_
2. Go to the top right and select **Administrator**.
3. On the right side, select **General Settings**.
4. On the category list, select **CodeScan**.
5. In the **CodeScan license** text box, type your license key (key is sf. license.secured).
6. Save the file.
