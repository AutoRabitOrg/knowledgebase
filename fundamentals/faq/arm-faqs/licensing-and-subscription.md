# Licensing and Subscription

### Why does my account show the outdated subscription list rather than the amended count list? <a href="#my-account-shows-the-outdated-subscription-list-rather-than-the-amended-count-list" id="my-account-shows-the-outdated-subscription-list-rather-than-the-amended-count-list"></a>

Update the total subscription allotted on your account. To do so, go to the **Admin > Subscriptions Management** section and update the **Subs. Allotted** and **Sub. Consumed** count.

### Why am I not able to assign licenses to my team member? <a href="#why-am-i-not-able-to-assign-licenses-to-my-team-member" id="why-am-i-not-able-to-assign-licenses-to-my-team-member"></a>

1. Check if your team members have additional administrator permissions. If more than one user has admin permission, this problem is more likely to occur.
2. Remove additional administrator permissions from your user's account.

### Why am I not able to add more users to my account? <a href="#why-am-i-not-able-to-add-more-users-to-my-account" id="why-am-i-not-able-to-add-more-users-to-my-account"></a>

You're getting this because you've used up all of your membership licenses, and you won't be able to add any more users. For any discrepancies or additional licenses, please contact to your account manager or reach out to us via support.

### Why am not able to assign more users to my team?&#x20;

The below-highlighted Subscription button will appear only if the customer procures more than 20+ licenses to manage different Teams.

### I see some plugins require keys. Is this a license issue or can we get these keys and use the Static Code Analysis feature? <a href="#i-see-from-the-instructions-that-these-plugins-require-some-keys-is-it-a-license-issue-or-can-we-get" id="i-see-from-the-instructions-that-these-plugins-require-some-keys-is-it-a-license-issue-or-can-we-get"></a>

You can use Apex PMD and execute SCA without having to obtain a license for it. The other plugins are third-party tools and they require the license.

* [SCA for CodeScan](../../../product-guides/codescan/)
* [SCA for Checkmarx](../../../product-guides/arm/integration-and-plugins/sca-for-checkmarx.md)
* [SCA for Apex PMD](../../../product-guides/arm/integration-and-plugins/apex-pmd.md)
* [SCA for SonarQube](../../../product-guides/arm/integration-and-plugins/sonarqube.md)
