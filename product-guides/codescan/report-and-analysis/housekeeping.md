# Housekeeping

## Retention Period

By default, CodeScan is set to delete inactive branches and pull requests (PRs) after 30 days, which is standard practice in SDLC for old feature branches. However, you can choose to keep inactive branches that you want to maintain.

### Changing Settings for Deleting Inactive Branches and Pull Requests

To change the settings for deleting inactive branches and PRs, navigate to the project you want to adjust. Go to **Project Settings > General Settings** and search for "**Delete inactive branches and PRs after."** Youâ€™ll find the option there, and you can change the settings accordingly. The default is 30 days for all projects.
