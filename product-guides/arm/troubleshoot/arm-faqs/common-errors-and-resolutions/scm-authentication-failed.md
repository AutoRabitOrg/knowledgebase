# SCM Authentication Failed

## Error message: SCM Authentication Failed

When a commit returns this error, it is either because:&#x20;

* Version control mapped to your Salesforce org user is incorrect.
* Your user credentials are incorrectly configured in ARM.

1. Ensure your account is correctly mapped with the version control branch to reflect the commits under your name.
2. Verify your credentials in the **Admin > Credential Manager** section and authenticate the connection again.
