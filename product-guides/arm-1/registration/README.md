# Getting Set Up

User Management enables you to manage your account where you can add a new user, edit user roles, remove a user etc.

The initial setup of ARM relies on several key steps:

1. Setting up a [version control repository](../../arm/registration/version-control-repository/)
2. Configuring ARM in accordance with your [version control branching strategy](../../arm/registration/version-control-branch/)
3. Connecting ARM to your [Salesforce Orgs](../../arm/registration/salesforce-org/)
4. Establishing a [Branching Baseline](../../arm/registration/branching-baseline.md)
