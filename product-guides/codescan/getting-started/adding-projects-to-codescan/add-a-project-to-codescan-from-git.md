# Add a Project to CodeScan from Git

This document guides how to add a git project to your CodeScan cloud account and run the analysis.\
This method can be used to add a project from any git-based SCM; however, if you use a cloud version of GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, we suggest you use the specific integration for your repository.

1. Login to your **CodeScan** account.
2. Once you log into your CodeScan account, click on the (**+**) icon in the top right corner and select **Analyze new project**.

3. It takes you to a different window. Choose the **Organization** for which you'd like to create a project.

    * Fill in the **GIT repository URL**. You can add two types of URL addresses in the field:
      1. An **HTTPS URL** like **`https://github.com/user/repo.git`**
      2. An **SSH URL**, like **`git@github.com:user/repo.git`** or  **`ssh://github.com/user/repo`**
    * Enter the Git **username** and the **security token** in their respective fields, followed by the **project branch** name.
    * Enter the CodeScan **project security key,** followed by the **project name**.
    * Under **Scheduling**, choose whether to run the project automatically by selecting **Daily** or manually by selecting **Manual**.
    * If you select **Daily**, another field named **Schedule** has to be selected by choosing the time you want the automatic analysis to be triggered.

**Note:** To know where to find the project key, refer to our document on how to do it by clicking [here](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/finding-your-project-key).
{% endhint %}

This triggers the project analysis and the added project under your [CodeScan](https://www.codescan.io/) organization.

This project will now run daily at the scheduled time unless configured otherwise.
