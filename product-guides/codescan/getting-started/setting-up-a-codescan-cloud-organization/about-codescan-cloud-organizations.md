# About CodeScan Cloud Organizations

A CodeScan Cloud organization is a collection of projects, users, and configurations used to customize CodeScan Cloud for your purposes.

When signing up for [CodeScan Cloud](https://www.codescan.io/products/cloud/), an organization is created automatically under your username. New organizations can be created at any time using the + icon at the top right side of the screen.

When using **`Invite User`** to add a new individual to the system, the user will be signed up and added to your Organization without having to create their own account.

Your billing is also linked to your Organization and applies to all projects within that Organization.

If you have any further questions about CodeScan Cloud organizations, reach out to our [Support Team](https://support@autorabit.com/).
