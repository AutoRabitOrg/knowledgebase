# On-Premises Releases

## Current Releases&#x20;

**Release Dates: August/September 2024**

**SonarQube Compatibility**: We recognize that our self-hosted customers have different requirements for SonarQube (SQ) versions. As such, CodeScan is committed to supporting a wide spectrum of versions to accommodate this variance.

**CodeScan On-Premises Versions:** As SonarQube continues to release new versions consistently every 2–3 months, we decided to offer two versions of CodeScan self-hosted to ensure ongoing compatibility. Review the following diagram for more information on the **two new editions** being released.&#x20;

Our July 2024 release (24.0.8) fully supports **SQ 9.9 LTA** as well as **SQ 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2.**

**For customers who run on these earlier versions of SonarQube**, we welcome you to upgrade to our new CodeScan Self-Hosted Tiger Edition (24.0.9). This release is generally available as of Sep 05 and is compatible with SQ 9.9 LTA and SQ 10.0–10.3.

**For customers running newer versions of SonarQube**, we welcome you to upgrade to our CodeScan Self-Hosted Eagle Edition (24.1.0). This release is generally available as of Aug. 28 and is compatible with SQ 10.1–10.6.&#x20;

We intend to keep as much feature parity with the Tiger and Eagle editions as possible; however, there will be slight variances. Refer to the corresponding release notes for [24.0.9 (Tiger)](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/overview/release-notes/codescan-release-notes/on-premise-releases/release-notes-24.0.9-tiger) and [24.1.0 (Eagle)](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/overview/release-notes/codescan-release-notes/on-premise-releases/release-notes-24.1.0-eagle) for complete documentation of features.

We are anticipating SQ 10.7 to be released in September 2024, and we plan to support it in November 2024. Starting with the 10.7 rollout, we intend to have support for the latest versions of SonarQube approximately 8 weeks after their release date. Each version will be supported for 12 months.
