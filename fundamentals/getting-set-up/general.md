#### What is an object? <a href="#what-is-an-object" id="what-is-an-object"></a>

An objects is represented as a database table which stores organization data . Objects consists of set of fields and we store data against that field.

#### Different types of object in Salesforce? <a href="#different-types-of-object-in-salesforce" id="different-types-of-object-in-salesforce"></a>

There are two types of objects in Salesforce:

* **Standard Objects-** Standard Objects are those which are created by Salesforce. We can use these standard objects automatically. For ex- Accounts, contacts, chatter, Leads etc.
* **Custom Objects-** Salesforce Custom objects are those which are created by user. We can create any number of custom objects. For ex- Student info, college etc.

#### What are the Standard and Custom Fields? <a href="#what-are-the-standard-and-custom-fields" id="what-are-the-standard-and-custom-fields"></a>

* **Standard fields** for custom objects stores the information about created by, modified by, currency, name, owner and dvision. These are the standard fields in Salesforce.
* **Custom field** for custom objects store unique data or information of an organization.

#### What is Page Layout and Record Types? <a href="#what-is-page-layout-and-record-types" id="what-is-page-layout-and-record-types"></a>

* **Page Layout-** In page layout customization can be done like fields, related lists, custom links can be arranged.
* **Record Types-** Record types helps to implement business processes like defining picklist values for standard and custom picklists.

#### Difference between Profiles and Permission sets? <a href="#difference-between-profiles-and-permission-sets" id="difference-between-profiles-and-permission-sets"></a>

* **Permission Sets-** In the Permission sets, we define the access level of the user. Generally we determine what a user can do in the applications. These are used to grant additional permission to a user.
* **Profiles-** Profiles are assigned to the user by system administrator. A profile can be assigned to many users where as a user can have only one profile.

#### Briefly describe about Field-Level Security? <a href="#briefly-describe-about-fieldlevel-security" id="briefly-describe-about-fieldlevel-security"></a>

We manage what a user can see, modify, and delete of a specific field in an object using field level security. In other cases, such as when we want to give a user access control over an object but we don't want them to be able to access certain fields in that object, we use field level security.

#### What are Governor Limits in Salesforce? <a href="#what-are-governor-limits-in-salesforce" id="what-are-governor-limits-in-salesforce"></a>

Governor Limits in Salesforce are the run time limits enforced by the apex runtime engine to write scalable and efficient code.

#### What is the difference between Trigger and Workflow? <a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-trigger-and-workflow" id="what-is-the-difference-between-trigger-and-workflow"></a>

* **Workflow-** Workflow is automated process, a point and click which doesn't need any coding. When you want to take action (email, task, field update or outbound message) for the same object or from Child to parent object, you can use Workflow rules. You cannot perform DML operation on workflow. Workflows work only after some actions.
* **Trigger-** Trigger is a programmatic code approach which fires when before or after a record is inserted, updated or deleted. Using trigger you can work on multiple objects. You can query and you can perform any DML operation. The trigger works before and after some actions.

#### Is AutoRABIT compatible with the deployment of CPQ data? <a href="#is-autorabit-compatible-with-the-deployment-of-cpq-data" id="is-autorabit-compatible-with-the-deployment-of-cpq-data"></a>
