8. Click **Save**.

7. Select the same **user's credential** created in **Step 1**.
8. Click **Test Connection** to check whether the connection has been authenticated. If so, a ‘success’ message is displayed after the authentication is completed.
9. Click **Save** and your ServiceNow integration is ready.
10. Once you log in, ServiceNow is integrated with your ARM account, and you can start logging bugs and issues with just one click directly to ServiceNow.

1. Select the checkbox: **Update ALM Workitem Status**
2. Select the **ALM type** as **SERVICENOW.**
3. Select the **ALM Label, project,** **sprint** and ALM work item for which the commit is planned.
4. Select the **work item** and the **status**.

5. Once the changes are committed to the version control system, the status of the ALM work item is updated and reflected in your ALM system.

**In CI Job**

**Important Notes:**

Configuring the ServiceNow work items is applicable to the following CI jobs:

* Package from Version Control
* Deploy from Version Control
* Deploy from the SFDX branch to a Salesforce Org
* Install an Unlocked Package from a Version Control Branch

1. Go to the **Build** section under the **New Create CI Job** screen.
2. Select the **Map ALM Project (Ex: ServiceNow)** checkbox.

3. Go to the **ALM** section. Here you can configure the work item type status in ServiceNow ALM to include in the build.

6. The active sprint(s) for the above-selected Project will be available in the **Sprint** dropdown. ARM has given provisions for you to update multiple sprints related to tasks or bugs and update the status on the go when running the CI Job. You can select either one of the sprints or, if you wish to update the status for all the sprints, leave it as default, i.e., keep **'All Active Sprints'** in the selected mode.

7. Select the **Work Item** type. Here you can select multiple work items to update the status for in your ALM. To use all the work item types, keep the **'All Work Item Type'** option selected by default.
