# Enhanced Compare Capabilities: View, Change View, and Export Results

Vault's Compare feature now includes three powerful options to enhance data review and usability:

* **View Records** – Quickly inspect individual records involved in the comparison.
* **Change View** – Switch between different comparison layouts for better clarity.
* **Export** – Download comparison results for offline analysis or sharing.

These additions provide a more flexible and actionable comparison experience.
