# Compare

Compare instance snapshots, data, and metadata in the same view. Following a data loss, [Vault](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/whats-new-with-autorabit-vault-march-2021-release-21-1/) compares various snapshots to determine the timing and root cause indicators. Vaultâ€™s compare feature delivers powerful capabilities that allow admins to quickly figure out what happened and estimate the impact.&#x20;

Benefits to Vault include:

1. Significantly reduced recovery time.
2. Visual interface to track and identify changes to data and metadata over time.
3. Compare backup snapshots with live [Salesforce data](../../../arm/update-salesforce-data.md).
4. Control granularity to entire org or individual objects etc.
