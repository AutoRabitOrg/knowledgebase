# User Definitions



{% hint style="info" %}
**ARM-Specific User Definitions**: The information below is generalized across the entire AutoRABIT suite of products. For information specific to ARM, please refer to the ARM User Definitions page [here](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/fundamentals/faq/autorabit-platform-user-definitions/arm-user-definitions).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Standard User**

A Standard User is an individual authorized by the Customer to log in to and fully utilize AutoRABITâ€™s subscribed products. Standard Users have access to all product functionalities, including the Web UI, IDE plugins, APIs, and other interfaces.&#x20;

Platform Owners/Admins are included in the Standard User class, ensuring administrative rights without affecting licensing terms.&#x20;

**Platform Integration User**&#x20;

A Platform Integration User is an individual authorized by the Customer to perform actions that trigger the execution of AutoRABIT products (directly or indirectly). &#x20;

This includes, but is not limited to:&#x20;

* Analyzing reports or data from AutoRABIT to identify and resolve code quality, security, compliance, or system performance issues.&#x20;
* Agents, bots, or systems executing actions via AutoRABIT to automate testing, deployments, or compliance checks.&#x20;
* Using AutoRABIT IDE plugins&#x20;
* Triggering AutoRABIT APIs&#x20;
* Directly changing Salesforce org configurations&#x20;
* Committing changes to a source code repository&#x20;

**Key Points:**&#x20;

* Automation (e.g., bots, agents) utilizing AutoRABIT for testing, deployment, or monitoring must be licensed appropriately.&#x20;
* Any person who commits code to a Source Code Management (SCM) system, where the commit directly or indirectly triggers a job in AutoRABIT, requires a Platform Integration License.&#x20;
* If a service account is used to trigger automation or integrate with AutoRABIT, the person or team responsible for the actual code commit must still hold a Platform Integration License. This ensures that each individual whose actions contribute to triggering AutoRABIT processes is appropriately licensed.&#x20;
* Any code commits triggering AutoRABIT jobs, directly or indirectly, manual or automate&#x64;**,** count toward Platform Integration Licenses.&#x20;

Example: In Git, multiple commits pushed simultaneously are counted individually toward user licensing.&#x20;

Platform Integration Users are included in licensing with view-only permissions.&#x20;

**Additional Notes:**&#x20;

* The number of licensed users represents the total unique users of the products throughout the Subscription Term.
