# What is a CodeScan License Key?

A CodeScan license key is provided for [CodeScan Self-Hosted](https://www.codescan.io/products/self-hosted/) customers upon the purchase or renewal of a CodeScan license.

The key is provided in the form of a string of characters to use when [Installing CodeScan Self-Hosted](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan-self-hosted) or downloading CodeScan plugins (in the absence of a [Subscription Key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-subscription-code)).

If you do not know your **License Key** or have misplaced it, please contact your Customer Success Manager or [support@autorabit.com](mailto:support@autorabit.com)
