# Benefits Comparsiton of AutoRABIT Test Automation Factory

AutoRABIT TAF has an enhanced Selenium Playback engine developed exclusively for the Salesforce Platform.

Once a recorded test script is played back with [AutoRABIT TAF](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/how-salesforce-test-automation-speeds-up-your-release-cycle/), there are three additional advantages:

1. The test script can be run on multiple Sandboxes without any additional effort.
2. The test script can be run on multiple data sets, where the data set can be entered from UI (User Interface) itself to accommodate positive/negative scenarios.
3. The test script can be chosen to run on every check-in/deployment done to a release environment.
