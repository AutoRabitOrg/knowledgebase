# Getting Set Up

User Management enables you to manage your account where you can add a new user, edit user roles, remove a user etc.

The initial setup of ARM relies on several key steps:
1. Setting up a [version control repository](../registration/version-control-repository/README.md)
2. Configuring ARM in accordance with your [version control branching strategy](../registration/version-control-branch/README.md)
3. Connecting ARM to your [Salesforce Orgs](../registration/salesforce-org/README.md)
4. Establishing a [Branching Baseline](./branching-baseline.md)
