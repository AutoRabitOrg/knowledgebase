# How to Set Up Guard

Getting started with AutoRABIT Guard takes just a few minutes. There’s no need to connect GitHub or any other infrastructure—we only require a connection to your Salesforce org.&#x20;

### Step 1: Log in to Guard&#x20;

Sign in to your Guard account.&#x20;

### Step 2: Open Settings&#x20;

In the right-hand menu, go to Settings.&#x20;

Note: AutoRABIT never sees or stores your Salesforce credentials.
{% endhint %}

Authorize Guard to connect with your Salesforce org. Once complete, the connection is established securely.

### Step 4: Let Guard Do the Work

That’s it! Guard will automatically:

·      Scan your org for vulnerabilities

·      Classify data in your custom fields

·      Check your security settings

_**You’re now ready to start using Guard!**_

Additionally, we recommend connecting with an Integration User License. Details on how to do this can be found here: [Integration User License](../integration-user-license.md)
