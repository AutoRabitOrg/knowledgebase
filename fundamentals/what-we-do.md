# ⚡ AutoRABIT Solutions

AutoRABIT delivers comprehensive **Salesforce DevSecOps solutions** tailored for regulated industries, ensuring **security, quality, and productivity** in Salesforce development. Since Salesforce was built as a Customer Resource Module (CRM) rather than a development platform, AutoRABIT simplifies complex processes through automation—enabling teams to achieve more with fewer resources.

* **CodeScan:** Performing static code analysis and applying policy management tools gives you total visibility into the health of your Salesforce environment, reduces costs, finds vulnerabilities, and decreases time to market.
* **Vault:** Implementing automated backup and recovery of Salesforce data, sophisticated data comparison tools, easy sandbox seeding, archiving, and comprehensive data management features ensures IT security, risk, and compliance needs are met.
