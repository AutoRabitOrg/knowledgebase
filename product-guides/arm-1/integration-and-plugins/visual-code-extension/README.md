# Visual Code Extension

### About Visual Code Extension

AutoRABIT offers a suite of products to automate CI/CD and data and metadata backup processes for Salesforce. The [Automated Release Management (ARM)](https://www.autorabit.com/products/automated-release-management/) suite for Salesforce allows teams to configure, build, test, and manage development, environments, and deployments on their Salesforce instance.

This will help Salesforce developers, admins, analysts, and release managers with out-of-the-box automation of version control.

### Purpose
