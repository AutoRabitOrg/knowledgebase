# Prerequisite while performing a commit using AutoRABIT

Complete the steps below before starting the AutoRABIT commit operation:

1. **Register your Version Control Repository in AutoRABIT**: An admin can perform this step only. Register your Version Control Repositories such as GIT, SVN, or TFS in AutoRABIT.
2. **Register your Salesforce organization in AutoRABIT**: AutoRABIT connects to your Salesforce Org using the secure OAuth method or **username/password** connections. This step can be performed by an admin only.&#x20;
3. **Set Up a Branch**: Instead of making changes to the code base directly, you can branch off from the main line and work on a specific feature in an isolated branch. This step can only be performed by an admin.
4. **Mapping the users with the Version control and Salesforce Orgs in the "My Profile" section**: Set up the permission to create a project in AutoRABIT.
