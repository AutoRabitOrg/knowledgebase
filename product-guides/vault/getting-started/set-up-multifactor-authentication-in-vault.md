# Set Up Multifactor Authentication in Vault

### What is Multi-factor authentication? <a href="#what-is-multifactor-authentication" id="what-is-multifactor-authentication"></a>

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** is a powerful, secure authentication method with two steps (or factors) to prove usersâ€™ identities when they log in. The first factor is information known to users, like usernames and passwords. The second is a verification method the user has in their possession, like an authenticator app or a security key. So multi-factor authorization makes it a lot harder for fraudsters to get access to your Vault data.

### Enabling MFA for your account <a href="#enabling-mfa-for-your-account" id="enabling-mfa-for-your-account"></a>

As an administrator of your account, you can enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every account member (global level) or at the user level.

Enabling MFA in your account at a global level affects all members of the account. This means that the users must enroll for MFA at their next login.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Points to Note:**

* Enabling MFA does not affect users already logged in, as the enforcement of MFA on the account takes effect only at new logins.
* Enabling MFA will mandate users to register their mobile devices for generating and validating tokens using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Salesforce Authenticator app.
{% endhint %}

1. In the **Vault** application, go to **`Manage Users > Users`**.
2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for every member in the account using the **`MFA toggle`** button located in the header or, look for the user from the list and enable the MFA by sliding the **`MFA toggle`** button to the right side.

### Reset MFA <a href="#reset-mfa" id="reset-mfa"></a>

You can reach out to your administrator to reset your MFA, if you have lost your phone or changed your device.

1. The administrator will reset MFA from the **`Manage Users > Users`** screen.
2. Click on the **`Reset`** icon (next to where the MFA toggle button is displayed).

3. This will enable the user to register his device again with a new bar code on the authenticator app when he tries to log in.
