# Reset Account Password

In general, you’ll only need to reset your password if you’ve forgotten it, but there are some instances when resetting your password can help protect the security of your account.

We recommend resetting your password in these cases:

* You notice something suspicious in your ARM account.
* You suspect someone you don't trust may have your password.
* We ask you to change your password.

If you have not requested to reset your password but receive an email asking you to change it, it could be a case of phishing. Instead of clicking on a suspicious link in an email, log in to your account to reset your password.

### Reset Account Password <a href="#reset-account-password" id="reset-account-password"></a>

Users can reset their password by clicking on the **`Forgot Password?`** link on the sign-in page.

Alternatively, users with administrator permissions can reset passwords for sub-users from the **`Users`** tab if a user has forgotten their password or their account has been compromised. The user whose password has been reset is signed out of active sessions and has to sign in again using their new password.

To reset a user's password:

1. Log in to your ARM account.
2. Hover your mouse over the **`Admin`** tab and click on the **`Users`**.
3. Locate the user whose password you want to reset.
4. Click on **`Reset`**.

5.  On the next screen, there are two options to choose from:

    * **`Auto-generate password:`** This option automatically generates a new password and is emailed to the user account. Once the password is received, users must log in and change it to something they can easily remember.
    * **`Let me create the password:`** This option allows users with the 'Admin' role or 'Manage Users' role permissions to create a password on behalf of users.

#### Password Requirements

New passwords must meet the following criteria:

* Must be at least **10 characters**

* Must be different from the last **5** **previously used passwords**
* Must not include **& < > ' \\" + = | \\\ ; ? , . \` {} \[] characters**
