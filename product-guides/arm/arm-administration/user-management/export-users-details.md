# Export Users Details

If you have **`Admin`** permissions, you can export a CSV file of all the users currently in your account. The CSV export will contain the following user information:

**Important Note**: When a user logs in to ARM, the browser pop-up message will ask permission to access the location details. If you **allow** permission, the location details will be retrieved through your browser, but if you **deny** permission, the location details will be retrieved through your IP Address.
{% endhint %}

**To export all users' details in CSV:**

1. On the **`Users`** screen, in the upper right, click **`Export All Users`**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fields like _`First Name, Last Name, Status, Email, and Login Name`_ are automatically selected by default when a CSV file is exported. If necessary, you can exclude them from being exported.
{% endhint %}

3. Your export will begin processing, and the CSV file will be downloaded on your local machine.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Export Data Limitations**: The parameters in the CSV for previously registered users (older than 60 days) will be slightly different:

* CreatedDate = OrgCreatedDate
* CreatedByName = registered user of the org
* LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedByName, Deactivated Date, and Deactivate by fields will be null

As expected, the exported CSV file will contain the newest parameter data and changes for newly registered users.
