# Project Analysis "Expired" Errors

Errors such as **Expired Token** on your **Project Analysis** page can sometimes be fixed by resetting the link to your code repository.

[CodeScan Cloud](https://www.codescan.io/products/cloud/) allows you to do this _without erasing_ the historical data present in your project.

To fix the above errors, first you need to delete the **Analysis Project**, to delete follow the steps below:

1. Go to your **Project** and navigate to the **Project Settings > Project Analysis** page.
