4.  Before deploying to the destination, review and select from the available deployment criteria to proceed.

    **Deployment Filters**

    1. **Disable Workflow Rules:** This option will deactivate the workflow rules associated with objects part of the deployment.
    2. **Use Bulk API (Batch API will be used if the option is not enabled):** You can transfer bulk records in one go from the source and destination org.
    3. **Use UTF-8 file encoding for file read and write operations:** Use UTF-8 as the internal representation of strings. Text is transcoded from the local encoding to UTF-8 when data is written to or read from a file. UTF-8 must be enabled if your data exclusively contains English alphabet. UTF-8 must be disabled if your data contains non-English alphabets. UTF-8 should be enabled by default in accordance with Salesforce.
    4. **Automap User/Owner Data:** To ensure user permissions differences between different environments will not affect the RBC deployments, users are provisioned to disable the auto-assignment of users as they trigger the RBC deployments.
    5. **Disable Validation Rules:** This option will deactivate the validation rules associated with objects part of the deployment.
    6. **Insert/update with Null Values:** This will either insert or update record field values with null in the destination org (if the value is null in the source org).
    7. **Enable Rollback:** Enabling this option makes sure that the done deployment can be rolled back to the desired previous state.
5. Continue to the "Preview" tab to review to go through the selection made and to either **"Retrieve Dataset"** or **"Retrieve Dataset, Deploy and Commit"**
6. on selecting either of the **"Retrieve Dataset"** or **"Retrieve Dataset, Deploy and Commit"** options, you would be redirected to the  "Deployment History" page.
