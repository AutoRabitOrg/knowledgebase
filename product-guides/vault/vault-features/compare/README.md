# Compare

Compare instance snapshots, data, and metadata in the same view. Following a data loss, [Vault](../../../../overview/release-notes/vault-release-notes.md) compares various snapshots to determine the timing and root cause indicators. Vault’s compare feature delivers powerful capabilities that allow admins to quickly figure out what happened and estimate the impact.&#x20;

Benefits to Vault include:

1. Significantly reduced recovery time.
2. Visual interface to track and identify changes to data and metadata over time.
3. Compare backup snapshots with live Salesforce data.
4. Control granularity to entire org or individual objects etc.
