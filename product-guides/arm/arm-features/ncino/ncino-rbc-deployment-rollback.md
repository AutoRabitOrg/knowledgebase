# nCino RBC Deployment Rollback

### Introduction

Rollbacks are an indispensable pillar in the realm of systems that undergo continuous evolution. They provide a safety net, enabling you to revert to a known, stable state if something goes wrong.

### Feature Overview

This feature allows users to perform a rollback of the deployments—if rollbacks were enabled when creating the deployments.

### Feature Considerations

To be able to perform rollbacks on the deployments, users must mark the deployments for rollback when configuring deployments.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Log in to your ARM account.

2. Go to the nCino module.
3. Rollbacks can either be performed through CI Jobs or Feature Deployment.

### CI Job Rollback

1. Once in the nCino module, click on the '**Create CI Job**' button.

5. On enabling the '**Enable rollback**' option, users can continue to '**Save**' the job.
6. While enabling the '**Enable rollback**' option, users can click on the question mark and read the message: “Please note that the data of this rollback will be retained for a period of 30 days and will be deleted as the retention period elapses.”
7. Upon saving the job, users are directed to the '**Job List**' page as shown.

16. A new build will be added to the list of the build in the following format: '**Rollback**' **- < Build No >**
17. Users can roll back the builds as often as needed.

### Feature Deployment

1. Initiate a '**Feature Deployment**' by clicking on the '**Feature Deployment**' button.
2. Continue to input the ‘**Source**’ and ‘**Destination’** configuration details.
3. On entering all the required details, click on the '**Create Dataset & Deploy**' button.
4. On clicking the '**Create Dataset & Deploy**' button, a popup with the '**Enable Rollback**' option is displayed.
5. Select the checkbox to enable the rollback of this deployment.

7. Until the deployment is completed, it is not possible to perform a '**Rollback**' on the deployment.
8. Click the '**Deploy**' button to deploy the build.
