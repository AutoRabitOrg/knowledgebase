Once a user has been created, it cannot be changed. The account must be deleted; follow the steps below:

1. To **delete** the user account: Ask your administrator remove you from the user list.
2. Make a **new account** with a different username and email address.
3. Ask your administrator to grant you all required **permissions** exactly as they were for the previous username and account.
