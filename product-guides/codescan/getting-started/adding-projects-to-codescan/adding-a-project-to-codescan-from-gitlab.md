# Add a project to CodeScan from GitLab

This document guides you through how to add a GitLab project to your CodeScan Cloud account and run the analysis.

1. Log in to your CodeScan account.
2. Once you log in to your [CodeScan](https://www.codescan.io/) account, click on the (**+**) icon in the top-right corner and select **Analyze new project**.

5. You will now see a new popup window; click on [**GitLab**](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/integrating-codescan-in-gitlab) from the given options.
6. Now another popup window appears with the fields: **Choose a repository**, **Project Branch**, **Check Pull Requests**, **Key**, and **Name.**
   * Choose the repository you want to add, followed by the project branch name.
   * Make sure you select the checkbox under **Check Pull Requests**. This will add **webhooks**.
   * Next, enter the **Project Key** followed by the **Project Name**.
   * Once you fill out all the details in the popup window, click on **Add and Run Now**.

**Note:** To find the project key, refer to our document [HERE](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/finding-your-project-key).
{% endhint %}

7. This triggers the project analysis and the project being added under your CodeScan organization.
8. You can view the project analysis report by clicking on **Details** from your VC repository.

9. When you click the link, it will take you to the **CodeScan Project** page, where you can view your project's log report.

Now that the webhooks have been created, every time a push or pull request is made to the tracked branch, an analysis will be triggered in CodeScan.
