#### What is a CodeScan License Key?

A CodeScan license key is provided for [CodeScan Self-Hosted](https://www.codescan.io/products/self-hosted/) customers upon the purchase or renewal of a CodeScan license.

The key is provided in the form of a string of characters to use when [Installing CodeScan Self-Hosted](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan-self-hosted) or downloading CodeScan plugins (in the absence of a [Subscription Key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-subscription-code)).

If you do not know your **License Key** or have misplaced it, please contact your Customer Success Manager or [support@autorabit.com](mailto:support@autorabit.com)

#### What is a Subscription Code?

A subscription code is an identifier for your CodeScan self-hosted license. It is a way to share download access with the necessary resources without providing your full [CodeScan License Key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-codescan-license-key).

When downloading [CodeScan plugins](https://www.codescan.io/products/editor-plugins/), you are required to fill in the below details:

* Enter your name
* Enter your email address
* Enter the subscription code or, your [CodeScan license key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-codescan-license-key)
* Accept the CodeScan [Terms of Service](https://www.codescan.io/tos/self-hosted/)
