# What can I do with ARM?

If you develop on the Salesforce platform, you can use ARM to:

* Rapidly compare environments to see the differences
* Quickly build deployment packages to get orgs in sync
* Integrate version control into your development process
* Set up advanced deployment automation
* Track changes between environments with detailed change reports
* Adopt Salesforce DX without the command line
* Reduce risks with rollback and metadata backups
* Improve team collaboration and reduce code conflicts
* Move data records between production orgs and sandboxes
