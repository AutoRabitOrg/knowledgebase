# Common Event Format (CEF) Data

Common Event Format (CEF) is a standardized logging format developed by ArcSight (now part of Micro Focus), a security information and event management (SIEM) solution provider. CEF is designed to simplify the process of logging security-related events, making it easier to integrate logs from different sources into a single system.

CEF is a text-based log format that uses Syslog as its transport protocolâ€”a standard for message logging supported by most network devices and operating systems. A full CEF message includes:

- **Syslog header (prefix)**
- **CEF header**
- **CEF extension** (a list of key-value pairs)

The extension supports both standard and user-defined key names.

### CEF Standard and Custom Key

This table lists the CEF key names used in events, along with their full names, types, applicable modules, data types, length limits, and descriptions.

> **Note:** The key name is what must be used in the actual event log.
