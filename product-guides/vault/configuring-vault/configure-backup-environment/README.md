# Configure Backup Environment

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The administrator must first set up the vault environment before working on backup/restore or other Vault features. This helps you to create a backup of the data/metadata in the storage environment and restore it if necessary. Vault supports a variety of environments, including Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure Blob, and Vault's default hosted environment.
