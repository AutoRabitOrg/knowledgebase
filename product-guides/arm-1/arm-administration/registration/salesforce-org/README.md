# Salesforce Org

You must register the organization to use any Salesforce Org functionality inside ARM. When you register your Salesforce organization in ARM, ARM connects to your organization with the required permissions.

By default, ARM connects to orgs using the secure OAuth method (our recommended approach). You can also connect to orgs using username/password connections if you need to.

### What is Salesforce Security Token, and How Do I Find It? <a href="#what-is-salesforce-security-token-and-how-do-i-find-it" id="what-is-salesforce-security-token-and-how-do-i-find-it"></a>

Your Salesforce security token is a case-sensitive alphanumeric key used with a password to access Salesforce via API. The token aims to improve the security between Salesforce users and Salesforce.com in the case of a compromised account. It ensures, among other things, that if a user’s account credentials are compromised, a third party cannot access Salesforce.

#### Losing the security token <a href="#losing-the-security-token" id="losing-the-security-token"></a>

If you can’t remember your security token and have deleted the email containing the token, the only way to retrieve it is by resetting the token. Salesforce does not provide an option to view your token within the web application; the only option is resetting it.

#### Getting the Security Token for Your Salesforce Account <a href="#getting-the-security-token-for-your-salesforce-account" id="getting-the-security-token-for-your-salesforce-account"></a>

When you create a Salesforce account, Salesforce sends an email message from support@salesforce.com with the subject: _salesforce.com security token confirmation_ to the email address associated with the account. This email message contains the Security Token for the account and is the only place where you can find the Security Token value. When you change the account password, the security token is regenerated (the previous one expires), and a similar email is sent.

To get the security token for your Salesforce account, In the mailbox for the email address associated with the Salesforce account, look for the latest email message received from _support@salesforce.com_ with the subject: _salesforce.com security token confirmation_.&#x20;

If you cannot find the latest email with the security token, reset the security token:&#x20;

1. Log in to Salesforce using the Salesforce account.
2. In the User Menu, select **`Setup`**.
3. In the menu on the left, under **`Personal Setup`**, expand **`My Personal Information`**, then click **`Reset My Security Token`**. Follow the instructions on the screen.
4. A new email message will be sent.
5. Open the message and then copy the **`Security Token value`**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note:** We recommend saving this email in a secure location, so you don’t have to reset your security token whenever needed.
