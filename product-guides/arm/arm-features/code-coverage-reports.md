# Code Coverage Reports

The code coverage report provides information about the apex tests that are run, the covered classes, the assertions that have failed, and the percentage of the code covered by the test execution for an org.

* To view the code coverage report, it needs to generate first.
* Also, it's a good idea to delete the existing apex class data from your Salesforce org before performing the code coverage.

### Generating the code coverage report <a href="#generating-the-code-coverage-report" id="generating-the-code-coverage-report"></a>

1. Hover your mouse over the **Admin** module and select the option: **SF Org Mgmt.**

2. Select the **Salesforce Org** and click on **Generate Code Coverage Report.**&#x20;

3. Next, fill in the details to run the apex test class for the selected Salesforce Org. Click **Update & Run**.

**NOTE**: If the test level is a **run-specific test**, ARM will check only **newly added code** against the specified test.

#### Apex Test Summary <a href="#apex-test-summary" id="apex-test-summary"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
* The **Apex Test Summary** tab was included in the **ARM 21.5** release. However, it will not be available to users who are still using prior versions.
* For newly generated code coverage reports, the apex test summary will be available; for old ones, you may see the following error: _**Code coverage summary file not found.**_
{% endhint %}

After running tests, you can view code coverage information in the **Apex Test Summary** screen. This screen includes the following information:

* Total number of tests that ran
* Code coverage statistics (classes/methods enqueued, completed, and failed)
* Error information for each failed test
* Information for each test that succeeds
* The time it took to run the test
