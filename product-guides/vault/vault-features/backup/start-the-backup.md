# Start the Backup

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Vault for Salesforce data security automatically performs backups for two kinds of structures:

* **Data:** Backup data in Salesforce is for records such as accounts, opportunities, contracts, leads, and cases. It also backs up Chatter, files, custom object records, and content.
* **Metadata:** Salesforce metadata backup refers to custom code like Apex and Visualforce and configuration settings like dashboards, reports, page layouts, and custom fields.

Vault suits the Salesforce environment and is built for our customers to protect their valuable data. Some features of our Salesforce backup tool include:

* **Dependable backups:** You can use Vault to back up your important content and recover it if the original file is compromised. Salesforce backup and recovery allows you to maintain the complete experience of Salesforce by preserving file attachments, knowledge feeds, and more.
* **Built-in archival:** Vault’s archival capabilities reduce storage costs for a more cost-effective solution. The archive tool is based on our scalable enterprise cloud infrastructure.
* **Metadata Mastery™:** Using Metadata Mastery™ with the AutoRABIT platform allows your company to back up and recover your Salesforce environment completely. This tool prevents Salesforce data loss by including metadata in its backups.

### Before you Begin <a href="#before-you-begin" id="before-you-begin"></a>

1. A **Salesforce Org** registered inside Vault. To register a new org, navigate to **`Setup > Register New Org`**. \[[Learn More](../../configuring-vault/registering-salesforce-org/)]
2. A **backup configured** for your Salesforce Org. The backup configuration job creates a snapshot of the data/metadata from your Salesforce org and is also helpful in retrieving the data required to restore successfully. \[[Learn More](../knowledge-articles/ncino/backup-configuration-for-your-salesforce-org.md)]
3. You have **permission** to create a backup job.

### Backing up your Data and Metadata <a href="#backing-up-your-data-and-metadata" id="backing-up-your-data-and-metadata"></a>

1. Login to your Vault account.
2. Go to the **`Backup`** module.
3. Select your **`Salesforce Org`**, **`Environment (Salesforce/nCino),`** and backup **`Configurations`** from the drop-down.Note:
   * A list of all scheduled and manual backups triggered to date will get displayed under the **`Backup Summary`** section.
   * To know more about the list of metadata and data being backed up or the configurations set for each backup, you can find it by clicking on the **`Backup Summary`** (<img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (69) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">) icon under the **`Actions`** tab.
4. To initiate a new backup, click on **`Backup Now`**.

5. On the next screen:
   * Enter the **`label`** of your choice or leave the auto-generated default label.
   * You'll be prompted to select your backup **configuration** again.
   * Select the **`Backup type`** for both metadata and data members. Vault recommends using the **Full-Backup** for metadata/data when performing a backup for the first time.
     1. **`Full-Backup`**: Full backup is a method of backup in which all the files and folders selected are backed up.
     2. **`Incremental-Backup`**: This method backs up only the data or metadata that has changed since the last backup operation. Vault allows incremental backups at intervals as short as every 5 minutes. Incremental backups identify changes by comparing file modification timestamps against the timestamp of the previous backup.
6. Select the **`Exclude Deleted Records`** checkbox to exclude the recently deleted records from your environment.
7. Click **`Backup`**.

### Downloading Files

Having this feature to download the files from the backup will enable the user to download the files directly from the Vault backup of the actual Salesforce data.

Steps to download files:

1\. Open the backup summary and navigate to the ‘files’ tab to download the files from the backup

2\. Click on the “Download” option to initiate the download of the files

## Limitations

* Inconsistent File Download During GDPR Requests: When a GDPR request is initiated within an organization, file downloads may behave inconsistently. This issue will be resolved in the upcoming release.
* File Download Issues with Special Characters in File Names: Files with special characters in their names may not function properly in certain environments, particularly on macOS. This issue will be addressed in the upcoming release
