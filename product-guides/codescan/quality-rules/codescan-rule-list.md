# CodeScan Rule List

The CodeScan rule list is always expanding. You can view the complete current list in the latest file below.

Our [Release Notes](../../../overview/release-notes/codescan-release-notes/) also have a record of when certain rules were added.

You can download the list of CodeScan rules from here:

Note: These rules do not apply to the plugin for on-prem as they will not function.
