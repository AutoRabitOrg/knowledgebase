7.  Commit Queue

    The **Commit Queue** provides a sequential view of all commit jobs that are scheduled for execution. This section allows users to review, manage, and prioritize commit operations within a selected repository and branch context. Commit queue functionality ensures orderly execution, preventing conflicts and preserving consistency during version control operations.

    1.  Accessing the Commit Queue: To view the commit queue:

        1. Navigate to the **Commit History** section via the left sidebar.
        2. Click the **"Commit queue"** button located at the top-right corner of the commit history table.

        <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/3 - Commit History.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
    2.  This action opens a slide-out panel on the right-hand side of the screen titled **Commit Queue**.

        #### Interface Layout and Fields
    3.  The commit queue panel is divided into a header note and a tabular data section.

        **Instructional Note**

        At the top of the panel, a note states:

        > "Jobs will be executed in order from top to bottom based on the updated priority. Ensure the sequence is correctly arranged before proceeding."

        <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/3.1 - Commit History.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
    4.  **Commit Queue Table:** Jobs in the queue can be rearranged based on priority, and execution will follow the defined sequence accordingly.

        When commit jobs exist, they are displayed in a table with the following columns:

        * **Repository** – Displays the name of the source code repository involved in the commit operation.
        * **Branch** – Indicates the specific branch under the selected repository.
        * **Comment** – Reflects any user-provided commit message or description entered during the commit process.
        * **Committed by** – Shows the username or email address of the individual who initiated the commit.
        * **Date** – Displays the date and time when the commit was added to the queue.
        * **Type** – Specifies the nature or classification of the commit job.
        * **Delete** – Provides a delete (trash) icon to remove the job from the queue if needed.
    5.  #### Empty State

        When there are no pending commit jobs, the queue displays the message **“No jobs found”**, as seen in the screenshot. This indicates that all commit jobs have either been executed or none have been added yet.
    6.  #### Final Actions

        At the bottom-right corner of the commit queue panel, two buttons are displayed:

        * **Cancel** – Closes the commit queue panel without saving changes.
          * **Save** – Confirms and saves any reordering or modifications made to the job list.
8.  #### Accessing the Revision Log from the Commit History Interface

    The Commit History interface includes an extended option set for each commit entry, facilitating a deeper view into the actions associated with a given commit. One such utility is the **Revision Log**, which allows examination of all files involved in the commit along with the type of actions performed on each.

    1.  **Viewing the Revision Log**

        To open the Revision Log for any specific commit:

        * Click on the ellipsis (three-dot) icon under the **Actions** column.
        * From the dropdown menu, select **Revision Log**.

        This opens a side panel displaying a structured list of files that were included in that particular commit.

    2.  **Details in the Revision Log**

        The Revision Log consists of the following information:

        * **File Name**: Shows the full path of the committed file relative to the repository structure. This helps identify the exact location and nature of the file (e.g., configuration, datasets, metadata).
        * **Action**: Indicates the operation that was executed on the file during the commit:
          * **M**: File was **modified**.
          * **A**: File was **added** as new content in the version control system.

9.  **File Diff Overview in Commit History**

    Within the Commit History module, each commit entry includes an action menu represented by an ellipsis (⋮) under the "Actions" column. Selecting the **"File Diff"** option from this menu opens a comprehensive comparison interface that highlights the differences introduced by the commit.

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/5 - Commit History.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    1.  #### File Diff Modal: Data Tab

        The **File Diff** modal is divided into two tabs—**Data** and **Filters**. The **Data** tab displays the structural content changes associated with the selected commit.

        <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/5.1 - Commit History.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        * The top-level entity in this section is the data container or template name (e.g., `arm_ncino-BrandTemplate3611-1.0`).
          * Each associated file is listed hierarchically under this container.
            * For each file, the following options are available:
              * **Download** icon to retrieve the file.
              * **Action Type** indicator showing "A" for additions.
              * A horizontal bar visualizing the volume of changes.
            * In the case shown, the changes include **48417 Additions**, **0 Deletions**, and **48417 Total Changes**.
    2.  File Diff Modal: Filters Tab

        Switching to the **Filters** tab within the File Diff modal enables the inspection of metadata filters applied during the commit.

        <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/5.2 - Commit History (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

        * Click on the **Download** icon to retrieve the file.
        * Each expandable section reveals the JSON content of individual files.
