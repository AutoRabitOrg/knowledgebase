# Salesforce - The Tools You Need to Be Successful

Salesforce is an essential cloud application that the ARM tool works with to build a successful **CI/CD pipeline**. Therefore, whether you are in support, engineering, enterprise services, product, or customer success, it is essential to have a Salesforce environment to replicate bugs, train, or verify bug fixes. In addition to Salesforce, it is critical to have a **Version Control System** to ensure that the version control is the source of truth.

There are several Version Control Systems out there, including **GitHub**, **Bitbucket**, and **Azure DevOps Server** (formerly known as TFS (Team Foundation Server)). Each client may utilize a different Version Control System, but ARM allows you to connect to the three most popular Version Control Systems, i.e., **GIT**, **SVN**, and **TFS**.

Salesforce provides a full copy of the **Lightning Platform** for free. This means you can get your own Developer Edition to integrate with ARM for free. You can get your very own instance by signing up at: https://developer.salesforce.com/signup.&#x20;

In addition to a Development Edition orgs and a Version Control System, having **Microsoft Visual Studio** **Code** is beneficial. Microsoft VS Code is a powerful source code editor on your desktop.&#x20;

You can download Visual Studio Code, which integrates GIT for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow this link to download for your appropriate platform: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

In addition to the tools mentioned above, it is recommended to install **Git Bash**. The URL to download Git Bash for Mac OS X, Windows, Linux/Unix can be found here: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git Bash is a command line through which users can use Git features, including standard Unix commands. One of the common Unix commands available through Git Bash is to add a file to your existing Git repository:

```actionscript
# create new file
$ touch README
```
