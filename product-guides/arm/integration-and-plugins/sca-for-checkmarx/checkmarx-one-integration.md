# Checkmarx One Integration

​Checkmarx One is a cloud-native application security platform designed to help organizations secure their software from the first line of code to deployment in the cloud. It offers a suite of integrated application security solutions, including static application security testing (SAST), software composition analysis (SCA), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and more.​

Integrating Checkmarx One into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline enhances code security by automating static code analysis. By configuring validation criteria, managing build statuses based on scan results, and utilizing Checkmarx One reporting features, development teams can maintain high code quality and address vulnerabilities promptly. This proactive approach ensures security is embedded throughout the software development lifecycle, aligning with modern DevSecOps practices.

## **Configure the Checkmarx One Plugin in ARM**&#x20;

From the Admin module, navigate to My Account > Plugins. In the Static Code Analysis category, select Checkmarx One.

### **Configuring Validation Criteria in CI Jobs**

To ensure code quality and security, it's wise to set up validation criteria for static code analysis within your CI pipeline. Validation criteria are predefined standards or conditions that must be satisfied to progress through the development pipeline, ensuring alignment with business requirements and functional correctness.

In the My Account section, scroll down to the Validation Criteria - Static Code Analysis section. Select Checkmarx One.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-24 at 3.33.19 PM (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

For priority, you can choose from the following severity criteria: critical, high, medium, low, and information.&#x20;

**Note**: The Checkmarx One plugin introduces a new severity level that is not present in the classic Checkmarx plugin: critical.&#x20;
