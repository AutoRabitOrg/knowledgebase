## I have admin access, so why can't I see some users' branches and commits listed under my organization? <a href="#i-have-admin-access-so-why-cant-i-see-some-users-branches-and-commits-that-are-listed-under-my-organ" id="i-have-admin-access-so-why-cant-i-see-some-users-branches-and-commits-that-are-listed-under-my-organ"></a>

This can happen if your user account is associated with a different organization.

***

## How would I update or change the username in all of the Salesforce Orgs specified in AutoRABIT? <a href="#how-would-i-go-about-updating-or-changing-the-username-in-all-of-the-salesforce-orgs-specified-in-au" id="how-would-i-go-about-updating-or-changing-the-username-in-all-of-the-salesforce-orgs-specified-in-au"></a>

To update the username on all registered orgs, re-authenticate the orgs in **Admin > SF Org Management** page.

## Is it possible to change the username for the AutoRABIT login after it has been created? <a href="#is-it-possible-to-change-the-username-for-the-autorabit-login-after-it-has-been-created" id="is-it-possible-to-change-the-username-for-the-autorabit-login-after-it-has-been-created"></a>

Once a user has been created, it cannot be changed; however, the user's email address can be changed. But, if it is mandatory to change the username, follow the steps below:

1. First, **delete** this user account: Request your administrator remove you from the user list.
2. Make a **new account** with a different username and email address.
3. Again, request your administrator to grant all required **permissions** exactly as they were with the previous user account.

***

## Can I change or switch the default branch repository in ARM since I currently have two default branches? <a href="#can-i-change-or-switch-the-default-branch-repository-in-autorabit-since-i-currently-have-two-default" id="can-i-change-or-switch-the-default-branch-repository-in-autorabit-since-i-currently-have-two-default"></a>

You can do this by first unregistering both branches and then re-registering your repository's default branch in AutoRABIT and setting the registered branch as the default branch.

***

## How can I view my organization-related support tickets in AutoRABIT? <a href="#how-can-i-view-my-organizationrelated-support-tickets-in-autorabit" id="how-can-i-view-my-organizationrelated-support-tickets-in-autorabit"></a>

## Unable to login into my ARM account. <a href="#unable-to-login-into-my-arm-account" id="unable-to-login-into-my-arm-account"></a>

If you're having trouble logging into your AutoRABIT account, here are some things you can try.

1. **The account is not created**: Please check with AutoRABIT admin to create a new account.
2. **The User ID and Password supplied to access the AutoRABIT account were incorrect or invalid**: Try resetting the password.
3. **Check if your account subscription has expired or your account is disabled**: If your AutoRABIT account has been disabled, you'll see a message saying your account is disabled when you try to log in.
4. If you get the error **“getAttribute: Session already invalidated, “**try clearing your browser cache.
5. **Restriction of your IP address**: Verify with your network team internally and verify if there are any issues or restrictions for your IP address from the network side.
6. If nothing works out, please reach out to us by raising a [Support Ticket](https://support.autorabit.com/portal/en/home)

***

## What if I am having login problems or forgetting my password? <a href="#what-if-i-am-having-login-problems-or-forgot-my-password" id="what-if-i-am-having-login-problems-or-forgot-my-password"></a>

If you're having trouble logging into your ARM account, or see a **Username or password is incorrect**, make sure that the email address you entered is the one you used when registering for your ARM account.\
If you continue to see this message, you can select **Forgot password** and enter the email address you used to sign up with ARM to receive a password reset email. You'll receive a password reset email from [notifications@autorabit.com](https://mailto:notifications@autorabit.com/).

***

## Not receiving the email to reset your account password <a href="#not-receiving-email-to-reset-your-account-password" id="not-receiving-email-to-reset-your-account-password"></a>

If you requested a new password but didn't receive your password reset email, then:

1. Did you enter the same email address you used to register your ARM account? Reset messages are only sent to registered email addresses.
2. Did you enter your email address correctly? Check for errors or try again.
3. Did you check your spam or junk message folders?
4. Did you try clicking the link to reset the password again?

### **Other Common login issues**

If you see a different error when trying to sign in, check for these common problems:

1. Did you complete the account registration process for ARM? To check, try registering again with the same email address. If the account does exist, a message will indicate that you entered a duplicate email address.
2. **Check if your account subscription has expired or your account is disabled**. If your ARM account is disabled, you'll see a message saying your account is disabled when you try to log in.
3. If you get the following error, **`“getAttribute: Session already invalidated,"`** try clearing your browser cache.
4. **Restriction of your IP address:** Verify with your network team internally whether there are any issues or restrictions to your IP address from the network side.
5. Make sure you are using a current version of **Firefox** or **Chrome**.
6. Make sure you have cookies and JavaScript enabled.

If nothing resolves the problem, please submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.autorabit.com/portal/en/home).

2. MUST contain at least **one uppercase** letter (A-Z)
3. MUST contain at least **one lowercase** letter (a-z)
4. MUST contain at least **one number** (0-9)
5. MUST contain at least **one special** character (such as !, %, @, <, >, #, and so on)
6. MUST NOT contain an email address, first, middle, or last name, or commonly used passwords
7. MUST NOT be one of the **5 previously used** passwords.

***

## How often do I have to change my password for the ARM application? <a href="#how-often-do-i-have-to-change-my-password-for-the-arm-application" id="how-often-do-i-have-to-change-my-password-for-the-arm-application"></a>

ARM has a 90-day rotational policy that requires you to change your password every 90 days. Follow the instruction [HERE](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/arm/docs/reset-the-password) to reset your ARM password.

***

## Why am I unable to register my Salesforce Org using an OAuth connection? <a href="#why-am-i-unable-to-register-my-salesforce-org-using-an-oauth-connection" id="why-am-i-unable-to-register-my-salesforce-org-using-an-oauth-connection"></a>

1. Verify in the user Salesforce Org if the AutoRABIT Connected App is **“Blocked,”** then unblock it.
2. Verify in the user Salesforce Org if any specific permissions are set for the Connected App.
3. Verify whether the redirect URL, client ID, and secret key in the **oauth.properties** file (path: .rabit/org/oauth.properties) are valid.

If the user is on a proxy-enabled server and receives an error such as **"Username may not be null,"** the proxy credentials must be validated. If the proxy username is set to **"null,"** the above error will occur.

***

## How will I track all the support tickets I created in ARM? <a href="#how-will-i-track-all-the-support-tickets-that-i-have-created-in-arm" id="how-will-i-track-all-the-support-tickets-that-i-have-created-in-arm"></a>

View all your support tickets via **Quick Links > Help Center** from the ARM application, which redirects to the Support portal page where you can see the list of open cases you or your team created.

***

## Which version of TLS does ARM run? <a href="#which-version-of-tls-does-arm-run" id="which-version-of-tls-does-arm-run"></a>

ARM runs on **TLS 1.2**; therefore, when Salesforce disables TLS 1.0, it does not affect ARM.

***

## What rules do I need to obey when naming identifiers for all the ARM application labels? <a href="#what-rules-do-i-need-to-obey-when-naming-identifiers-for-all-of-the-labels-in-the-arm-application" id="what-rules-do-i-need-to-obey-when-naming-identifiers-for-all-of-the-labels-in-the-arm-application"></a>

There are some rules you have to follow for naming identifiers:

* Must contain at least three characters (5+ recommended)
* Uppercase letter (A-Z) is allowed
* Lowercase letter (a-z) is allowed
* Number (0-9) is allowed
* Special characters (- and,) are allowed.

***

## What is the primary reason for restricting special characters when naming identifiers? <a href="#what-is-the-primary-reason-for-restricting-special-characters-when-naming-identifiers" id="what-is-the-primary-reason-for-restricting-special-characters-when-naming-identifiers"></a>

It is done to restrict XML injections and prevent XML file corruption.

***

## Where is the API token key used in the ARM application? <a href="#where-is-the-api-token-key-used-in-the-arm-application" id="where-is-the-api-token-key-used-in-the-arm-application"></a>

1. The API Token generated via ARM will be used to authenticate within the application and provide access to get details of the CI Job configured & its build details.
2. To use the AutoRABIT capability, each user has their API token, which should not be shared with anyone. If you encounter something phishing, deactivate your current API token and create a new one.

***

## Who is authorized to access the API Token? <a href="#who-all-are-authorized-to-access-the-api-token" id="who-all-are-authorized-to-access-the-api-token"></a>

Super Admins, Org Admins, and the users with admin-level permissions are authorized to access the API token.

***

## What browsers does ARM support? <a href="#what-browsers-does-arm-support" id="what-browsers-does-arm-support"></a>

ARM works best in the two most recent versions of these browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari

***

## Not able to login to ARM using Chrome browser <a href="#not-able-to-login-to-arm-using-chrome-browser" id="not-able-to-login-to-arm-using-chrome-browser"></a>

1. Try logging in to your account using Chrome in incognito mode.
2. Clear the Chrome browser cache.
3. If cleaning the cache does not help, try a different browser (Firefox) and see if the problem persists.
4. If the problem is solely with Chrome, reinstall it.

***

## Given the shift in IP ranges, is it possible to migrate from one AutoABIT instance to another? <a href="#given-the-shift-in-ip-ranges-is-it-possible-to-migrate-from-one-autoabit-instance-to-another" id="given-the-shift-in-ip-ranges-is-it-possible-to-migrate-from-one-autoabit-instance-to-another"></a>

Yes, this is achievable; however, your [Salesforce Orgs](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/salesforce-org) must be re-registered in AutoRABIT, and permissions provided to the relevant AutoRABIT users must be re-granted.

***

## Why am I able to see some of the users that are deleted in AutoRABIT? <a href="#why-am-i-able-to-see-some-of-the-users-that-are-deleted-in-autorabit" id="why-am-i-able-to-see-some-of-the-users-that-are-deleted-in-autorabit"></a>

1. **The deleted user's credential exists in AutoRABIT**: Go to _**Admin > Credential Manager**_ and type in the username that exists. You should find a record if it is still there.
2. [**Version Control**](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/8-benefits-of-version-control-in-salesforce-development/) **repository is registered with the existing user's credentials**: Get your existing user credentials updated with the new user details with the help of your admin. To do so, go to the **Credential Manager** section, search for the existing user credential, and get it updated with the new user details. Or, create a user credential for the new user and re-register the existing version control repository.

***

## Why do my users not have access to all of the features available in ARM? <a href="#why-my-users-do-not-have-access-to-all-of-features-available-in-arm" id="why-my-users-do-not-have-access-to-all-of-features-available-in-arm"></a>

1. Your users may not have the authority to access the modules he is looking for; nevertheless, users with administrator privileges will only have access to certain features. To see the user's available roles in AutoRABIT, go to the **Admin > Roles** section.
2. For the necessary permissions, contact your **Org Admin**.

***

## Is it feasible to update the repository URL without re-registering it in ARM? <a href="#is-it-feasible-to-update-the-repository-url-without-having-to-reregister-the-repository-in-arm" id="is-it-feasible-to-update-the-repository-url-without-having-to-reregister-the-repository-in-arm"></a>

The repository URL cannot be changed; you must use the new repository URL and re-register it with ARM. To register a new repository, click this [link](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/version-control-repository).

***

## What is the functionality of the "Sync Branches" radio button on VC Repo's screen? <a href="#what-is-the-functionality-of-sync-branches-radio-button-in-vc-repos-screen" id="what-is-the-functionality-of-sync-branches-radio-button-in-vc-repos-screen"></a>

This radio button allows you to view branches that are no longer available in your version control repositories but are still visible in the ARM application, and you can delete them from the ARM application.

***

## Why am I getting a Credential Name error while trying to Save Mappings? <a href="#why-am-i-getting-a-credential-name-error-while-trying-to-save-mappings" id="why-am-i-getting-a-credential-name-error-while-trying-to-save-mappings"></a>

If you're a sub-user and get an error message _**"Credential with name: "qa private token cred" for this UserEmail does not have permission to save mapping"**_ while saving **Org Mapping**, the admin must **reregister** the repository **credentials** and make the credentials **Public**. The sub-user must then use the newly registered credentials.

***

## Why am I unable to create branching baselines for UAT and new SIT and getting an error while trying to create a new branch from VC Repos? <a href="#why-am-i-unable-to-create-branching-baselines-for-uat-and-new-sit-and-getting-an-error-while-trying" id="why-am-i-unable-to-create-branching-baselines-for-uat-and-new-sit-and-getting-an-error-while-trying"></a>

Depending on the error, the credentials may have expired. Check the repository credentials and then **Test Connection** in ARM. Then retrigger the branching baseline. Please contact our support team if the problem continues.

***

## Why is Test Connection in ARM failing even after re-authenticating the credentials? <a href="#why-is-test-connection-in-arm-failing-even-after-reauthenticating-the-credentials" id="why-is-test-connection-in-arm-failing-even-after-reauthenticating-the-credentials"></a>

If you have already re-authenticated, but the issue is still unresolved, it may not be a credential issue. Please contact our support team so we can **whitelist the domain** from our end with the SRO team. Once this is whitelisted on our end, you must also whitelist the **Instance IPs** on your network side.

***

## How can I remove the previous Super Admin from ARM and assign access to myself? <a href="#how-can-i-remove-the-previous-super-admin-from-arm-and-assign-access-to-myself" id="how-can-i-remove-the-previous-super-admin-from-arm-and-assign-access-to-myself"></a>

Please contact the AutoRABIT support team; we will adjust the license to make you **Super Admin**. Once you have that access, you can log into ARM with your credentials and delete users without access.

***

## I have refreshed one of our branches by using the Branching Baseline option. The process was successful, but is there no Revision# created? <a href="#i-have-refreshed-one-of-our-branches-by-using-the-branching-baseline-option-the-process-was-successf" id="i-have-refreshed-one-of-our-branches-by-using-the-branching-baseline-option-the-process-was-successf"></a>

Before proceeding with the Branching Baseline operation, please ensure you have the Write permission on the selected branch. Please refer to the knowledge base article below for more information: [Branching Baseline](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/branching-baseline?highlight=branching%20baseline%20screen%20appears)

## Is there a way to change an existing user’s email address without deleting the user? <a href="#is-there-a-way-to-change-an-existing-users-email-address-without-deleting-the-user" id="is-there-a-way-to-change-an-existing-users-email-address-without-deleting-the-user"></a>

As of now, you cannot simply change the email address of an existing user, either active or inactive. Your Admin must delete the user; then, the user can create a new account with the desired email address.

***

## Why is my On-Prem ARM Test Server not working even after I have restarted the server and also restarted the processes? <a href="#why-is-my-onprem-arm-test-server-not-working-even-after-i-have-restarted-the-server-and-also-restart" id="why-is-my-onprem-arm-test-server-not-working-even-after-i-have-restarted-the-server-and-also-restart"></a>

If there is a problem with the **Test Server** instance, we suggest you restart it. However, please restart the services first and then restart the server. This should resolve the issue.

***

## AutoRABIT displays unwanted changes and removes picklist options from branches when deploying changes to RecordTypes picklist values. <a href="#autorabit-displays-unwanted-changes-and-removes-picklist-options-from-branches-when-deploying-change" id="autorabit-displays-unwanted-changes-and-removes-picklist-options-from-branches-when-deploying-change"></a>

If you have selected the below configuration for recordTypes picklistValues under **Admin > Salesforce settings > Configuration for recordTypes picklistValues**, it will replace all picklist values with new picklist values.

**Solution:** Select the **Append** button so that instead of overriding the entire record type picklist values, it adds to the existing ones.

***

## Why can’t my colleague with Deployment Manager, Developer, and Pull Request Reviewer roles Approve/Reject Merge and EZ-Commits? <a href="#why-cant-my-colleague-with-deployment-manager-developer-and-pull-request-reviewer-roles-approverejec" id="why-cant-my-colleague-with-deployment-manager-developer-and-pull-request-reviewer-roles-approverejec"></a>

Please edit the role assigned to the user and ensure that the below-mentioned special permissions are enabled for that role:

1. Gated check-ins approver
2. EZ-Merge approver.

***

## I see from the instructions that these plugins require some keys. Is it a license issue, or can we get these keys and use the Static Code Analysis feature? <a href="#i-see-from-the-instructions-that-these-plugins-require-some-keys-is-it-a-license-issue-or-can-we-get" id="i-see-from-the-instructions-that-these-plugins-require-some-keys-is-it-a-license-issue-or-can-we-get"></a>

You can use Apex PMD and execute SCA without having to obtain a license for it. The other plugins are third-party tools, and they require a license.

* [SCA for CodeScan](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/en/codescan?highlight=Static%20Code%20Analysis)
* [SCA for Checkmarx](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/en/checkmarx?highlight=Static%20Code%20Analysis)
* [SCA for Apex PMD](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/en/apex-pmd?highlight=Static%20Code%20Analysis)

## We’re switching from an on-premises GitHub account to the Cloud version of GitHub. I created the GitHub cloud account and tried setting up the cloud connection in ARM, but the system gave me an error. <a href="#were-switching-from-an-onpremises-github-account-to-the-cloud-version-of-github-i-created-the-github" id="were-switching-from-an-onpremises-github-account-to-the-cloud-version-of-github-i-created-the-github"></a>

Once the GitHub cloud account is created, you should also be able to set it up with ARM. If you’re facing any issues, the repository might still be migrating. If so, you are unable to register the repository during that time. But after the migration, you should be able to register the repository in ARM.

***

## How can I set up SSO in ARM? <a href="#how-can-i-setup-sso-in-arm" id="how-can-i-setup-sso-in-arm"></a>

## I am trying to run the Branching Baseline job in ARM. Why is the job status showing as hanged for more than 24 hours? <a href="#i-am-trying-to-run-the-branching-baseline-job-in-arm-why-is-the-job-status-showing-as-hanged-for-mor" id="i-am-trying-to-run-the-branching-baseline-job-in-arm-why-is-the-job-status-showing-as-hanged-for-mor"></a>

Usually, the metadata retrieval would fail due to timeout. Please re-run the baseline and reduce the batch size. If this doesn’t resolve the issue, contact the AutoRABIT support team, and we should be able to assist further after inspecting the logs.

***

## Why can’t I see the Pull Request Plugins dropdown and the Enable Pull Request Support checkbox in the Admin VC Repo page when the repository is registered with SSH? <a href="#why-cant-i-see-the-pull-request-plugins-dropdown-and-the-enable-pull-request-support-checkbox-in-the" id="why-cant-i-see-the-pull-request-plugins-dropdown-and-the-enable-pull-request-support-checkbox-in-the"></a>

**Pull requests** are currently not supported for repositories authenticated via **SSH** protocol. However, an **HTTPS-based** connection via username and personal access token is supported.

***

## I want to add a user like I could before. Why can’t I see the User Management section anymore? <a href="#i-want-to-add-a-user-like-i-could-before-why-cant-i-see-the-user-management-section-anymore" id="i-want-to-add-a-user-like-i-could-before-why-cant-i-see-the-user-management-section-anymore"></a>

The **User Permissions** and **Roles** in your organization may have been rearranged. Please contact your Admin and they should be able to grant you the necessary permissions again.

Please check your credentials because your Bitbucket account username differs from your email address. Once you have confirmed your username, try to register the repository, and then test to see whether branch creation was successful.

***

## I am unable to register a Salesforce Org. Why isn't my users' list displayed on the Profile page? <a href="#i-am-unable-to-register-a-salesforce-org-why-isnt-my-users-list-displayed-on-the-profile-page" id="i-am-unable-to-register-a-salesforce-org-why-isnt-my-users-list-displayed-on-the-profile-page"></a>

If you're unable to register a Salesforce org in ARM because the user's list is not displayed in the **My Salesforce Orgs** section of the **Profile** page, ensure the following:

1. The options below must be enabled for the particular user in the Salesforce org:
   1. **ModifyAllData**
   2. **ViewAllData**
   3. **ApiEnabled**
   4. **AuthorApex**
   5. **CustomizeApplication**
2. The ARM **IP address** must be **whitelisted** in Salesforce. Go to the **User Logins** history in the Salesforce org and look under **Restricted IPs**. Here the ARM IPs must be whitelisted.
