### Configuring Your Bitbucket Repository <a href="#configuring-your-bitbucket-repository" id="configuring-your-bitbucket-repository"></a>

#### Prerequisites for registering Bitbucket with ARM <a href="#prerequisites-for-registering-bitbucket-with-arm" id="prerequisites-for-registering-bitbucket-with-arm"></a>

* You must have a Bitbucket account. If you don’t already have a Bitbucket account, you can create one at [https://start.atlassian.com/](https://start.atlassian.com/) Once you have a Bitbucket account, you can create a new repository or use an existing one.
* You must have permission to register a repository.
* Store your Bitbucket’s credentials in ARM.

#### Store your Bitbucket credential in ARM <a href="#store-your-bitbucket-credential-in-arm" id="store-your-bitbucket-credential-in-arm"></a>

This is an initial step where you store your user's credential (usually a username, password, or token) in ARM.\
To authenticate Bitbucket, you’ll have to use **App Password** instead of the regular password to login to your Bitbucket account.

**Steps to generate a Bitbucket App Password**

1. Log into to your Bitbucket account.
2. Click your account’s **`profile picture`** in the top right-corner of the Bitbucket webpage.
3. Click the **`Personal Settings`** link in the dropdown menu.
4. Select the link on the left labeled **`App Passwords`**. It is under the **`Access Management`** heading.
5. Click on **`Create App Password`** button.
6. Give a **`label name`** and check all the necessary permissions that you’d want to provide. Typically, we will require **`repository`**, **`webhook`**, and **`pull request permissions`**.
7. Click **`Create`** to generate the Bitbucket App Passwords and copy the access token’s value. You will not be able to view this password again once you close this window.
8. Click **`Save`**.
