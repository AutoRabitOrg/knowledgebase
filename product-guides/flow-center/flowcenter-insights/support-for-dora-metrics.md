# Support for DORA Metrics

## DORA Metrics in FlowCenter Insights

FlowCenter Insights can help you in your journey towards thinking about software delivery performance by showing how your deployment data correlates or influences the key DORA metrics.

For each widget, you will see two pills showing how it is related to the DORA metrics. This helps you connect the dots between “simple” metrics and more complex metrics related to company and team performance.

## Understanding DORA Metrics

DORA metrics, developed by the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team, are essential indicators for measuring software delivery performance and DevOps maturity. These metrics provide valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of development and operations processes. There are four key DORA metrics:

1. **Deployment Frequency**: This metric measures how often your organization deploys code to production or releases it to end users. High-performing teams typically deploy on demand, often multiple times per day. Frequent deployments indicate a streamlined process with smaller, manageable changes.
2. **Lead Time for Changes**: Lead time for changes measures the time it takes for a code commit to get into production. This metric highlights the speed of your development process from initial code changes to deployment. Shorter lead times suggest a more efficient pipeline, allowing for faster delivery of features and bug fixes.
3. **Change Failure Rate**: This metric calculates the percentage of deployments causing a failure in production, such as service outages or significant bugs. A lower change failure rate indicates a more stable and reliable delivery process, with fewer disruptions caused by new releases.
4. **Time to Restore Service**: Time to restore service measures how long it takes to recover from a production failure. This includes identifying the issue, implementing a fix, and restoring normal service. Faster recovery times demonstrate a team’s ability to quickly address and resolve issues, minimizing downtime and impact on users.
