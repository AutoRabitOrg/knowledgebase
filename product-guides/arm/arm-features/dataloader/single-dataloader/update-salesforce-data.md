# Update Salesforce Data

The following article describes using **Single Dataloader** to update data in Salesforce. The data is updated via a CSV file.

1. Log in to your ARM account.
2. Hover your mouse over the [**`Dataloader`**](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/10-benefits-of-salesforce-data-loader/) module and select **`Dataloader`**.
3. Click **`Update`** on the right side of the screen.

4. Choose your **`Salesforce Org`** and your org environment (**`Production or Development Edition`**, **`Sandbox`**, or **`Pre-Release`**).
5. The corresponding **`URL`** and your **`Username`** are automatically generated based on the above selection.
6. Click **`Login and Fetch Objects`** to fetch all the objects from your Salesforce Org.

7. Select the object for which you wish to update the data. For example, **`Account`**, **`Contact`**, **`Lead`**, etc. You can use the **`Search`** function to search through your objects and the **`filter`** button to filter your standard/custom objects quickly.
8. Click **`Next`**.

9. Import your file from your local directory on the next screen. Upload the **`CSV`** file you wish to import by clicking the **`Upload`** button.

10. A notification pop-up will display the number of records that will be impacted. Click **`OK`**.

11. The next step is to prepare your field mappings. Field mappings match columns in your CSV to fields in your Salesforce Org.
12. You can automatically map the members and the fields using **`Automap`**. It compares the destination fields with the fields available in uploaded CSV files, and if both match, the value is selected automatically.

13. The number of fields mapped out of the total number of fields is displayed below the **`Automap`** checkbox.
14. Use the **`search`** option to look up a field by name from the long list to map it.
15. Use the **`Filter`** dropdown to choose which fields to display:
    * **`All:`** Displays all fields, whether they have been mapped or not.
    * **`Mapped:`** Displays only the fields which have been mapped yet.
    * **`Unmapped:`** Displays only the fields which haven't been mapped yet.\
      After selecting the filter, the list updates automatically as you map or unmap each field.
16. Make sure you have mapped all the required fields. Otherwise, you can't move forward. Click **`Next`**.
17. On the **`Process Summary`** screen, you can:

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (55) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

    * Give the process/job a **`Name`**.
    * Select the **`Category`**. Categories are used to classify and group similar processes having similar functionality. In simple terms, you are assigning similar processes to a category. You can either select an existing category or create a new category by clicking the **`+`** icon.
    * View the main **`Object`**.
    * View the operation **`Type`** (**`Update`**).
    * View the number of impacted **`Records`**.
    * **`Use Bulk API`**.About Bulk APIThe Bulk API is based on REST principles and is optimized for inserting, updating, and deleting large data sets. You can use the Bulk API to process jobs in **serial** or **parallel** mode. Processing batches serially means running them one after another, while processing batches in parallel means running multiple batches simultaneously. When you run a Bulk API job, processing more batches in parallel means giving that job a higher degree of parallelism, providing better overall data throughput.
18. You can schedule your tasks so they start running regularly. You can choose between **`Daily`**, **`Weekly`**, or **`On-demand`** schedules.
19. Finally, click **`Save`** to save your task and run it later.
20. Your task is listed on top of the lists in the **`Dataloader Summary`** screen.
21. Click **`Run`** to run the Dataloader immediately before the scheduled time.

22. Select the criteria you can set for the dataloader process to continue:

UTF-8 must be disabled if your data contains non-English alphabets. UTF-8 should be enabled by default as per Salesforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

23. Click **`Run`**.

24. The number of successful or failed records updated can be seen in the **`Results of Last Run`** section. The values in this field are updated dynamically while the job is still running. You can view the records or download them to your local system. The records are generated in CSV format.
