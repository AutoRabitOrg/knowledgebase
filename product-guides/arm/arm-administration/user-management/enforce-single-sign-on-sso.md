# Enforce Single Sign-On (SSO)

The Administrator can enforce SSO for members of your team. This will make it mandatory for all team members to log in via SSO.

To enforce SSO, enable the SSO login configuration:

1. Go to the **My Account** page, and under the **SSO Configuration**, select the **Disable login with AutoRABIT credentials** checkbox.
2. Click **Save**.

Your team members will now be required to log in via SSO only. Even if SSO is enforced, you, as an org administrator, can log in using either standard authentication (username/password) or SSO.

If you, an org admin, want to override the SSO configuration for an individual team member or group of users, you uncheck the **`Enforce SSO`** boxes after selecting the team members from the list.
