# Setting Up Multi-Factor Authentication in Vault

## What is Multi-Factor Authentication? <a href="#what-is-multifactor-authentication" id="what-is-multifactor-authentication"></a>

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is a security mechanism that requires two forms of identity verification before granting access:

- **First factor**: User credentials such as a username and password.
- **Second factor**: A one-time verification code generated by an authenticator app or provided via a security device.

Enforcing MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your Vault data by requiring something the user **knows** and something the user **has**.

## Enabling MFA for Your Vault Account <a href="#enabling-mfa-for-your-account" id="enabling-mfa-for-your-account"></a>

Vault administrators can enable MFA either **globally for all users** or **individually per user**.

### Global MFA Enforcement

1. Log in to your **Vault** account.
2. Navigate to **Manage Users > Users**.
3. Toggle the **MFA switch** in the header to enable MFA for all users in the account.

### Per-User MFA Enforcement

1. Navigate to **Manage Users > Users**.
2. Find the specific user in the list.
3. Enable MFA by sliding the **MFA toggle** to the right for that user.

**Important Notes:**

- Enabling MFA does **not** affect users who are already logged in. MFA will be enforced at the next login.
- Users will be prompted to **register a mobile device** with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Salesforce Authenticator).

## Reset MFA <a href="#reset-mfa" id="reset-mfa"></a>

If a user loses their device or switches to a new phone, they must contact an administrator to reset their MFA setup.

### Admin Steps to Reset MFA:

1. Go to **Manage Users > Users**.
2. Locate the user and click the **Reset** icon next to the MFA toggle.

3. On the user's next login, they will be prompted to scan a **new QR code** to register their authenticator app.
