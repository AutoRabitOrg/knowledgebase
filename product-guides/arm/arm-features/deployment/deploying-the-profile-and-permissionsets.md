8. About Object Permissions in Profiles, Editing standard objects on standard profiles is not supported by Salesforce. Hence, these changes won't show up in your destination environment.

**Important Notes:**

1. Based on the size of your Profiles, the time taken for comparison can vary. You can navigate to a different screen and return to the **`Profile Manager`** page once the results are ready and available.
2. To optimize browser performance, it is recommended to compare one access setting at a time (in case of large profiles).
{% endhint %}

11. On the next page, you can see a list of permissions available for each metadata component. Here, you can update the permissions for each component for all the orgs at once.

    * Permissions/ Components that are not available will be denoted by **`X`** in the org.
    * For the fields that are left blank. For example, in **`Apps`** and **`Datasources`**, no related record type is assigned; hence, nothing shows up or will display '**`No Data Found`**'.
