# Policies

## Overview and How It Works

The Policies feature in AutoRABIT Guard offers a powerful, automated mechanism to enforce governance and security in your Salesforce org. Unlike Salesforce’s native functionality, Guard Policies allow you to define strict access control rules, such as permission set allow lists, to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive permissions.

Guard monitors your org in real time, detects violations, and can immediately act by reverting changes or notifying admins. This feature is the backbone of secure and compliant Salesforce operations.

## Key Features

### Permission Set Allow List Policies

Permission Set Allow List Policies allow you to control who can be assigned specific permission sets. For example, you can define a policy that ensures only certain users are allowed to have a permission set that provides access to critical data.

* Prevent Unauthorized Access: Prevent unauthorized users from being granted permissions that expose sensitive data.
* Ensure Compliance: Enforce strict policies for who can access certain permissions, ensuring compliance with both internal and external regulatory standards.

### Real-Time Monitoring and Enforcement

Guard continuously scans your Salesforce org every five minutes to detect violations in real time.

* Continuous Monitoring: Guard scans your org every five minutes, identifying and responding to policy violations quickly.
* Violation Actions: When a policy violation is detected, Guard can:
  * Revert Changes Immediately: Automatically remove unauthorized permission sets, reverting the change to a compliant state.
  * Notify Admins: Alert admins via email to manually review and resolve the violation.

### Flexible Policy Configuration

Guard allows you to easily configure policies that fit your specific needs.

* Policy Details: Name the policy for easy identification and specify the Salesforce org where it applies.
* Policy Criteria: Select the permission sets and users involved in the policy. This flexibility ensures the policy can be customized to fit your needs.
* Remediation Actions: Define how violations should be handled, whether by automatically reverting the change or notifying admins. You can also specify which email addresses will receive notifications.

### Detailed Violation Notifications

When Guard detects a policy violation, you receive detailed alerts that give you the information necessary to quickly resolve the issue.

* The alert will include:
  * The permission set involved in the violation.
  * The user assigned the permission set.
  * The action taken, whether the permission set was reverted, or the admin was notified.

### Scalable Governance Framework

Guard’s policies are just the beginning. The platform is designed to scale with your organization’s needs and will soon include other capabilities, such as password policies and governance rules.

* Future releases will expand the types of policies available, offering even more granular control over your org’s security and compliance.

## Why Policies Matter

### Enforce Governance with Automation

Guard automates the enforcement of access rules, ensuring that your org remains compliant without manual oversight. This eliminates the risk of human error and guarantees consistent application of security policies.

* Automation means fewer missed violations, less time spent managing security, and more time spent focusing on other business-critical tasks.

### Protect Sensitive Data

By controlling who has access to what permissions, Guard ensures that unauthorized users do not gain access to sensitive business data, such as financial, medical, or proprietary information.

* Enforcing permission set policies helps prevent data breaches and keeps sensitive information secure.

### Maintain Compliance

Guard helps your organization meet both internal governance standards and external regulatory requirements by ensuring real-time enforcement of your policies.

* Guard ensures compliance with both industry standards (e.g., HIPAA, SOX) and your organization’s internal security policies.

### Boost Efficiency

Guard’s policies can automatically revert violations or send actionable alerts for manual review, saving your team time and effort.

* Policies reduce the burden of constant manual oversight, giving your team time to focus on more strategic tasks.

## How It Works

### Create a Policy

To create a policy, go to the Policies section in AutoRABIT Guard and click "Add Policy."

* Provide a descriptive name for the policy, such as "Policy for Admin Permissions."
* Configure policy criteria by selecting the Salesforce org, permission sets, and users who fall under the policy.

### Configure Policy Criteria

* Salesforce Org: Choose the Salesforce org where the policy will apply.
* Permission Sets and Users: Select the permission sets you wish to monitor and the users allowed to access them. This ensures that only authorized users have access to critical permissions.

### Define Remediation Actions

* Auto-Revert or Notify: Decide whether violations should trigger an automatic revert (removal of unauthorized permissions) or a notification to admins for manual remediation.
* Email Notifications: Specify the email addresses for receiving violation alerts. Admins will be notified when violations occur, ensuring they can take appropriate action.

### Activate and Monitor

* Save and Activate: After configuring the policy, save it and activate it.
* Real-Time Monitoring: Guard will continuously monitor your Salesforce org every five minutes, ensuring that any violations are detected and acted upon in real time.

## How Policy Violations Are Detected and Handled

Guard’s policy detection relies heavily on the Change Monitoring capability, which tracks changes in your Salesforce org. When a policy is violated, Guard parses these changes to determine if they violate the defined rules.

## **Parsing Events: How Changes Are Monitored**

Guard is built on top of Change Monitoring, which uses Salesforce’s SetupAuditTrail to track changes. When a change occurs that might violate a policy, Guard parses the event details to determine whether the violation is valid. Let’s look at an example of how this works:

1. Change Event Detection: A change occurs, such as the assignment of a permission set to a user:
   1. Event: "Permission set Nebula Logger: Admin assigned to user policy user (UserID: \[005Wy000000uRLh])"
2. Before and After Values: Guard detects and extracts the before and after values from the event. In this case:
   1. Before Value: The user did not have the permission set assigned.
   2. After Value: The permission set is now assigned to the user.
3. Event Parsing: Guard uses this information to determine the permission set involved ("Nebula Logger: Admin") and the user assigned to it (\[005Wy000000uRLh]).
4. Policy Comparison: Guard then checks whether this event violates any existing policies:
   1. If there is a Permission Set Allow List Policy for "Nebula Logger: Admin," Guard checks whether the user is on the allow list.
   2. If the user is not on the allow list, the event is flagged as a violation.
5. Reverting the Offending Change: If the violation is detected, Guard automatically reverts the change (i.e., removes the unauthorized permission set from the user), ensuring compliance.
6. Email Alerts: If the policy is configured to notify admins instead of automatically reverting the change, an email alert is triggered, providing admins with all relevant details.

## Handling Special Cases

Some policies, such as those based on specific permissions (e.g., only user A, B, and C can have the "Modify All Data" permission), require additional logic to determine whether a violation has occurred.

For example:

* Guard tracks permission set assignments and checks if specific permissions (like "Author Apex") are granted to users.
* If a policy specifies that only certain users can have a permission set that grants "Author Apex," Guard will remove the permission set from any user not on the allow list.

Currently, Guard does not handle edge cases where permission sets are modified after being assigned. For example, if a user already has a permission set and it is modified to include a new permission, Guard will not automatically remove the permission set until the assignment itself is changed. This limitation will be addressed in future releases.
