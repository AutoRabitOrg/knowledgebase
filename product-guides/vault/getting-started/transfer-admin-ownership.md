### Our admin user has left and we need to move permissions over

If the admin user has left the company, we can assist with the ownership transfer. However, we require an authorization email from another administrator or from the **companyâ€™s CEO** sent to [support@autorabit.com](mailto:support@autorabit.com). This verification step is necessary to protect the integrity and security of your Vault data.
