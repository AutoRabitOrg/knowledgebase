Note regarding the 2 different CodeScan Self-Hosted Editions:&#x20;

We recognize that our self-hosted customers have different requirements regarding the SonarQube (SQ) versions that are supported/allowed by their organizations. As such, CodeScan is committed to supporting a wide spectrum of versions to accommodate this variance.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Currently, the most recent Long Term Active version of SonarQube is 2025.1 LTA.  The previous version of SonarQube Long Term Active (LTA) was 9.9 LTA. In between, SonarQube released 9 other versions (10.0 – 10.8).

In order to support all these SonarQube versions, we decided to provide two versions of CodeScan self-hosted editions to the market to ensure ongoing SonarQube compatibility. &#x20;

Our Eagle Edition is designed for those customers who run on SonarQube 10.4 – 2025.1 LTA.&#x20;

Our Tiger Edition is designed for those customers who run on SonarQube 9.9 LTA – 10.3. &#x20;

Please see our corresponding [SonarQube Compatibility Matrix ](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/product-guides/codescan/system-requirements-and-installation/installing-codescan-self-hosted#sonarqube-tm-download-1)for detailed guidance.&#x20;

We do intend to keep as much feature parity with the editions as possible; however, there will be slight variances. Please review our release notes for detailed information regarding each edition’s respective capabilities.&#x20;

Additionally, the following diagram provides more detailed information regarding release versioning and release dates. &#x20;
