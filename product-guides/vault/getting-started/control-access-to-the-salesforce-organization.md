# Control Access to the Salesforce Organization

The org administrator can restrict their users to access only those Salesforce orgs which has been authorized to them. Users will be able to perform Vault operations in their Salesforce org based on their org access, such as backup, restore, replicate, comparison, and archival.

The **Enable org. access control** toggle in the **Manage Users** page is switched on by default. This indicates that the admin has the org access control permission and can specify which users have access to which Salesforce org(s) in the Vault account. If the toggle is turned off, all users in the Vault account will have access to all registered orgs.
