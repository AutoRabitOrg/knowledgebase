# Unable to fetch Salesforce Org Users

## Error message: Unable to fetch Salesforce Org Users

This error may be encountered when a user tries to access the Salesforce Org in the ARM Version Control, CI Jobs, Deployment, and SFDX Modules. This may occur due to an invalid username, password, or security token, if the user is locked out, or if the Salesforce API version is incorrectly configured.&#x20;

Upgrade the API source flow in your Salesforce org to the most recent version and maintain the same Salesforce version in ARM by going to **Admin > My Account > My Salesforce Settings** and updating the API version.
