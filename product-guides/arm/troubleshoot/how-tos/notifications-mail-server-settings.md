### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

You can use the mail server settings in this article to manually set up your email to send and receive an email with an iCloud email account. AutoRABIT requires mail server settings to send the AutoRABIT notification emails for events like build failures, build success, deployment failure, merge reports, etc.&#x20;

Begin the process by hovering your mouse over the **Admin** module and selecting the option: **Notifications**.
