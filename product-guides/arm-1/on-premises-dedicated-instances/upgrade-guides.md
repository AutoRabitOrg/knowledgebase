## Instance Upgrade Requests

### Introduction

To ensure a seamless instance upgrade, please follow the instructions below to schedule downtime with the AutoRABIT Support Team.

### Overview

Once a code change has successfully passed Quality Assurance (QA) and is ready for deployment, our Support Team will notify you via an existing support ticket, if applicable.

If you wish to proceed with an upgrade after reviewing the release notes, please contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) directly or email the Support Team with your preferred downtime slot, as detailed below.

> **Note:** While the deployment itself typically takes around one hour, we allocate a four-hour maintenance window to accommodate any contingencies and to allow QA to conduct a post-deployment sanity check.

### Available Maintenance Windows

You may select one of the following maintenance windows for your instance upgrade:

* **Slot 1:** 8:30 PM – 12:30 AM PST
* **Slot 2:** 1:00 AM – 5:00 AM PST

### Requesting Downtime

To schedule a maintenance window for your instance upgrade, please complete the following steps:

1. **Select a Date:** Identify your preferred upgrade date.
2. **Choose a Maintenance Slot:** Select either Slot 1 or Slot 2.
3. **Contact Support:** Email the Support Team with the following details:
   * Chosen date
   * Selected maintenance slot
   * Any additional comments or questions

### Important Notes

* **Notice Period:** A minimum of 24 hours' advance notice is required to schedule the upgrade.
* **Downtime Duration:** While the upgrade usually completes within an hour, the full four-hour window should be reserved to ensure a stable deployment.
