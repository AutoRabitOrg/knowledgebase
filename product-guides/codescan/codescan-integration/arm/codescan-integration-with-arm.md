## CodeScan SCA Results <a href="#codescan-sca-results" id="codescan-sca-results"></a>

During the implementation phase of a Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), [Static Code Analysis](https://www.autorabit.com/products/codescan/) is usually performed as part of a Code Review.

* CodeScan being a Static Analysis tool continuously detects and reports on data flow problems, software defects, language implementation errors, inconsistencies, dangerous usage, coding standard violations, and security vulnerabilities.
* ARM generates a detailed SCA result report and the Lint runs by default every time you run a [static code analysis](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/static-code-analysis). Lint analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
* Lint Report will only display information about AuraBundle components.

These reports will have information about the files that were reviewed and its related violations.

To display CodeScan results that are applicable for all kinds of tools (CodeScan, Checkmarx, Apex PMD, Salesforce Scanner, SonarQube), you will be presented with the following screens:

1. **Components and Layout**:
   * **Left Sidebar**:
     * **Metadata List**: Display a list of all metadata types.
     * **Fields List**: The corresponding fields will be displayed when a user clicks on a specific metadata type.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image-20240612-161907.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Right Pane**:
  * **Issues List**: Display a list of issues related to the selected metadata and fields.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image-20240612-161928.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Code Lines**: When a user clicks on an issue, display the relevant lines of code where the issue occurs.

**Top Section**:

* **Grid View**: Display an overview grid containing information such as files, violations, and other relevant statistics.
* **Details in Grid View**:
  * **Files**: List of scanned files.
  * **Violations**: Total number of violations, categorized by severity (e.g., critical, major, minor).

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image-20240612-162042.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

2. **User Interactions**:
   * **Metadata Navigation**: Users can browse and select metadata types from the left sidebar.
   * **Field Display**: Upon selecting a metadata type, fields related to that metadata type will be displayed.
   * **Issue Details**: Clicking on a field will show issues related to that field on the right pane.
   * **Code View**: Clicking on an issue will display the specific lines of code related to that issue on the right pane.
   * **Top Grid Interaction**: The grid at the top allows users to get an overview and drill down into specific files and their violations.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: In CodeScan, when you select the baseline branch for the analysis from ARM, the branches will be listed under Comparison Branches. If the baseline is not selected, they will be listed under Standard Branches.
{% endhint %}
