Note regarding the two different CodeScan Self-Hosted editions:&#x20;

We recognize that our self-hosted customers have different requirements regarding the SonarQube (SQ) versions that are supported/allowed by their organizations. As such, CodeScan is committed to supporting a wide spectrum of versions to accommodate this variance.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Currently, the most recent Long-Term Active version of SonarQube is 2025.1 LTA. Recently, SonarQube released Community Build 25.10, while the latest version for their other editions is 2025 Release 5.&#x20;

The previous version of SonarQube Long-Term Active was 9.9 LTA. In between, SonarQube released 9 other versions (10.0–10.8).

In order to support a wide range of these SonarQube versions, AutoRABIT decided to provide two versions of CodeScan self-hosted editions to the market to ensure ongoing SonarQube compatibility. Please note that we currently only certify CodeScan on the Community Build. We are working closely with SonarQube to extend our verifications on their other editions as well.&#x20;

Our Eagle Edition is designed for those customers who run on SonarQube 10.6, 2025.1 LTA, 25.2, 25.3, and 25.4.&#x20;

Our Tiger Edition is designed for those customers who run on SonarQube 9.9 LTA–10.3. &#x20;

Please see our corresponding [SonarQube Compatibility Matrix ](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/product-guides/codescan/system-requirements-and-installation/installing-codescan-self-hosted#sonarqube-tm-download-1)for detailed guidance.&#x20;

We do intend to keep as much feature parity with the editions as possible; however, there will be slight variances. Please review our release notes for detailed information regarding each edition’s respective capabilities.&#x20;

Additionally, the following diagram provides more detailed information regarding release versioning and release dates. &#x20;

### Recommendations on Editions&#x20;

_For customers running newer versions of SonarQube_, we encourage you to upgrade to our CodeScan Self-Hosted Eagle Edition v5.0 (25.1.2). This release is generally available as of October 17, 2025, and is compatible with SQ 2025.1 LTA, 25.2, 25.3, 25.4, and SQ 10.6–10.8. Please refer to the release notes for [Eagle Edition v5](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/release-notes/release-notes/codescan-release-notes/on-premise-releases/eagle-edition/release-notes-25.1.2-eagle-5.0) for complete documentation of features.

_For customers running older versions of SonarQube,_ we encourage you to upgrade to our CodeScan Self-Hosted Tiger Edition v3.0 (25.0.1). This allows customers to have a newer version of the CodeScan plug-in while utilizing older versions of SonarQube™.
