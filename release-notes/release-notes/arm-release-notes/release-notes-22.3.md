# Release Notes 22

## ARM Release Notes 22.3

We would like to inform you about the End of Life (EOL) for ARM version 22.3. Per our support agreement, this version is now more than 365 days old and is no longer supported. As part of our ongoing commitment to providing the best possible experience for our users and maintaining the highest standards of security and performance, we have made the decision to discontinue support for ARM 22.3.

**End of Life Date: April 1, 2024**

What Does This Mean?

* End of Support: As of April 1, 2024, we will no longer provide maintenance updates, bug fixes, or technical support for ARM 22.3. This includes both security and non-security updates.
* Security Risks: Continuing to use ARM 22.3 after the end of support date may expose your system to potential security vulnerabilities, as we will no longer release security patches.
* Upgrade Recommendations: We strongly recommend migrating to a supported version of ARM to ensure continued reliability, security, and performance. Our team is available to assist you with this transition process and provide guidance on your upgrade.
* Accessing Resources: While official support for ARM 22.3 will no longer be available, you can still access existing resources such as documentation, knowledge base articles, and the Knowledge Hub for reference purposes.

Action Required:

To mitigate any potential risks associated with the EOL of 22.3, we urge you to take proactive steps towards upgrade immediately. Our customer success and support team are here to assist you every step of the way. Please reach out to your CSM to plan this work.

We understand that this transition may present challenges, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience it may cause. However, we believe that focusing our efforts on our latest offerings will ultimately benefit you with enhanced features, improved performance, and better security.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.



**December 2022 - Version 22.3 - New Features, Enhancements, Improvements and Changelogs**

**Date of release:** _18 December 2022_\
**Article last updated:** 31 _July 2023_

### New Features <a href="#new-features" id="new-features"></a>

#### 1. Retention Policy <a href="#id-1-retention-policy" id="id-1-retention-policy"></a>

You can now define a data **Retention Policy** and choose how much data should be stored for how long. ARM will now be considerably quicker by eliminating outdated data. Clearing out old and useless data from the database and moving it to the archives keeps the application from underperforming and improves speed across all modules.

A weekly clean-up will ensure that the application runs smoothly. The default data retention period is set as 12 months which will be implemented with the release of **ARM version 22.3**. Admins can specify the duration of data retention in the history tables from the My Account section and change the retention period from **12 months** to **6 months** or **3 months**.\

#### 2. Search, Group, and Filter CI Job List <a href="#id-2-search-group-and-filter-ci-job-list" id="id-2-search-group-and-filter-ci-job-list"></a>

Finding a **CI Job** has never been easier. Instead of scrolling through endless pages, you can search for a job or a group by simply typing the name in the new dropdown lists. You can further narrow the search results by combining these two options to look for a particular job within a group.

Additionally, the **filter** feature provides further options to narrow the search results by source type, date range, and more.\

#### 3. Ability to Abort a Vlocity Deployment <a href="#id-3-ability-to-abort-a-vlocity-deployment" id="id-3-ability-to-abort-a-vlocity-deployment"></a>

We just included new functionality to the **ARM 22.3 version** that allows users to terminate an ongoing Vlocity deployment process or abort it if get stuck. The **Deployment History** screen contains the **Abort** option, which allows you to terminate the deployment process.\

### Enhancements <a href="#enhancements" id="enhancements"></a>

#### 1. Release Label Revamp <a href="#id-1-release-label-revamp" id="id-1-release-label-revamp"></a>

The revamp of the **Release Label** page is the feature of version 22.3 that stands out the most. This enhancement is actually a collection of multiple smaller enhancements, each of which is briefly discussed in this section.

* While creating a release label, you can choose the specific period for which you want to retrieve the **commit history** instead of loading the entire commit history, which could take a really long time.
* You can also create a release label while simultaneously creating a **package** simply by selecting a conveniently located checkbox on the same screen.
* The **selected revisions** are also displayed on the same screen and updated dynamically as you select/unselect revisions.
* Release labels are **color-coded** on the **Release Label Summary** screen for easier identification, and the search now provides leaner results.

#### 2. Additional Metadata Support in Search and Substitute <a href="#id-2-additional-metadata-support-in-search-and-substitute" id="id-2-additional-metadata-support-in-search-and-substitute"></a>

Additional metadata types are now compatible with the **Search and Substitute** rule, allowing the application to use them for Deployments and Commits.

Until now, the Search and Substitute functionality only had the ability to select a metadata type and then perform the search for substrings across all members in that type. But now, you can select specific metadata members in a type and substitute values for that member(s).

This enhancement is also helpful when users want to add object permissions only to the production and not to the lower sandboxes.

It is also beneficial to have this feature so that the rules can be created and used in **CI Jobs** to do the replacements automatically, depending on the deployment settings in the CI Job.\

#### 3. Additional details in the Users Export List <a href="#id-3-additional-details-in-the-users-export-list" id="id-3-additional-details-in-the-users-export-list"></a>

**Export List** is a comprehensive list of all registered users with an organization. This list can be downloaded from the **Users** module. It includes details like the users' name, email, and title; and information about user accounts created, modified, deactivated, and deleted.

With the recent release, the **Export List** will include a few additional details related to the **last login** to ensure security and compliance. Details like the **location, login type, IP address, coordinates,** and the **browser** used.

The access level of users is not mentioned in the export list for security reasons, i.e., if any users are **Admin** or **Super Admin**, this will not be specified. The company can share this list, if required, with people both inside and outside their organization without jeopardizing the confidentiality of the access granted to the users.\

#### 4. Dataloader Clone process <a href="#id-4-dataloader-clone-process" id="id-4-dataloader-clone-process"></a>

In addition to providing a new name, **Dataloader users** can now specify a different Salesforce org as a source or destination for the operation while cloning an existing job. This helps the users to reuse the same job configuration with a different Salesforce org without going through the entire process again.

For the **Extract** operation, users have the option to edit the query corresponding to the new org selected. For **Insert/Update/Upsert/Delete** operations, users have the option to upload a different **.CSV** file instead of the original one. Validation is done to verify whether the object is available in the new org and also if the user edits the query for the cloned process.\

***

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* The `/syncbranchcommits` service is no longer supported. The users will no longer require **Auto-sync** functionality to create a release label. This simplifies the function's use and gets rid of unnecessary steps.
* For improved user experience, the **metadata.zip** file upload option has been added to the **New Deployment** page itself. When uploading large files, this is extremely useful.
* The **password policy** is reduced from **13** previously used passwords not being allowed to **5** previously used passwords. This gives users more options while resetting their passwords after the **three months** period or if they forget their password.
* Improvements have been made to **VC Repo flow** as well as to **Salesforce Org flow**. You can now run scans on a repo or an org to be tagged to the same project and run comparisons so that you have traceability across the scans. The comparison feature allows for every delta scanned to be compared with the baseline. Scans are run on the source, and the results are available in the **Reports** module. Users can trace the jobs run using the unique identifier.\
  Click [HERE](../../../product-guides/arm/static-code-analysis.md) to see a few points to note about these improvements.
* **Super Admin** and the user currently logged in are disabled for ALL actions. They cannot be added, deleted, suspended, activated, deactivated, edited, or their roles delegated to other users. Super Admin is displayed at the top of the users' list for easy identification.
* The **Users** module now displays the last login date and time of the users instead of the phone number, and the first and last names appear under the single **Name** column for better monitoring and tracking.
* **Super Admin** can now enter the desired thread pool count while registering an ARM agent.
* Customers can now request for **Pendo** and **Full Story** to be enabled or disabled for their instance. Simple toggle buttons to do this are added under the **Product Analytics** section on the **Super User Accounts** page. Only **Super Admin** will have access to this section.
* In **DataLoader**,
  * The number of records that are going to be impacted by the specific operation (Extract, Insert, Update, Upsert, or Delete) is displayed as a message before the operation begins and also on the **Summary** screen as **Records**.
  * **Filters** have been added to differentiate between the mapped and unmapped fields when auto-map is selected.
  * **Success** and **error count** of records is displayed while the job is still in progress.\

In addition to the existing static code analysis tools, ARM now provides the ability to choose the **Salesforce Scanner CLI** plugin.

Most static code analysis tools specialize in one language or a set of languages. Many applications (including typical Salesforce packages), however, contain an assortment of components created using different languages. A single static analyzer is insufficient to address all aspects of such applications, and managing multiple static analyzer tools could prove unfeasible.

This is where the **Salesforce CLI Scanner** plugin shines. This plugin aggregates the results of static analyzers that are most relevant to Salesforce developers while providing a unified experience.

With the Salesforce CLI Scanner plugin, you can look forward to a:

* Single installation process
* A single set of commands to interact with multiple rule engines
* A unified set of rules that are checked by their respective rule engines
* Unified rule violation report that includes all issues identified by the engines.

#### 3. AutoRABIT for nCino <a href="#id-3-autorabit-for-ncino" id="id-3-autorabit-for-ncino"></a>

We’ve added the ability to view and review datasets corresponding to each version of the nCino feature template before using it for deployment. Prior to this release, the capability was available only for the latest version of the template.

### Enhancements <a href="#enhancements" id="enhancements"></a>

#### 1. ApexPMD Upgrade to 6.49 version <a href="#id-1-apexpmd-upgrade-to-649-version" id="id-1-apexpmd-upgrade-to-649-version"></a>

With this release, PMD has been upgraded to version **6.49**. If you have not uploaded a rules file, ARM will use the default Apex PMD rules file. However, you can add new rules to the default ruleset.

Click [HERE](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_next_major_development.html#list-of-currently-deprecated-rules) to view the list of currently deprecated rules available on GitHub.

#### 2. Auto-approve on validation success <a href="#id-2-autoapprove-on-validation-success" id="id-2-autoapprove-on-validation-success"></a>

We have moved one step closer to automating the flow by adding an option to choose if an **EZ-Commit** or an **EZ-Merge** should be approved automatically if the SCA validation is successful. Combined with the existing option to auto-commit on approval, this leads to a true CI/CD experience.

#### 3. HashiCorp Vault Integration <a href="#id-3-hashicorp-vault-integration" id="id-3-hashicorp-vault-integration"></a>

While adding HashiCorp credentials to ARM, you can now choose the **AWS Authentication** method so that the Vault Token will be generated automatically whenever the existing token expires. Now the user will not have to update the token manually from the application when it expires.

#### 4. SFDX CLI Upgrade <a href="#id-4-sfdx-cli-upgrade" id="id-4-sfdx-cli-upgrade"></a>

The SFDX CLI has been upgraded to the latest stable **7.169** version.

Key characteristics to look for:

* Support for the **quick deploy** functionality for SFDX jobs.
* Use CLI commands to generate the package manifest and rollbacks.

#### 5. Salesforce Winter (API 56.0) Support <a href="#id-5-salesforce-winter-api-560-support" id="id-5-salesforce-winter-api-560-support"></a>

#### 6. Merge to multiple branches <a href="#id-6-merge-to-multiple-branches" id="id-6-merge-to-multiple-branches"></a>

With this release, you can choose to **merge** from one **source branch** to multiple **destination branches** upon successful deployment.

#### 7. OAuth for Jira <a href="#id-7-oauth-for-jira" id="id-7-oauth-for-jira"></a>

In addition to the **Standard** access type, users can now set up **SSO** as authentication for **Jira** using the OAuth access type while registering an ALM. You can also switch between **Standard** and **OAuth** access types for already registered ALMs.

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Users with Admin access can now turn off the Jira comments and notifications created by AR. This ensures a cleaner workspace. These comments and notifications are very development centric, so the end users who use Jira cannot make sense of our technical comments from AR, and this may create confusion for them.

## **ARM Release Notes 22.1**

**Date of release:** _20 March 2022_\
**Article last updated:** _23 October 2022_

### New features <a href="#new-features" id="new-features"></a>

#### 1. Squash and merge <a href="#id-1-squash-and-merge" id="id-1-squash-and-merge"></a>

We have added the **Squash and Merge** feature in this release. Sometimes, when merging a long list of changes from a development branch into the master, it's helpful to squash those commits into one change for ease of review and declutter the repo's commit history. AutoRABIT offers an option to squash all commits in a merge request into one commit after the merge is approved and completed.\

#### 2. SFDX- Import packages <a href="#id-2-sfdx-import-packages" id="id-2-sfdx-import-packages"></a>

**Packages**

The users could previously build a new package (unlocked or managed) and update the package's version in Salesforce DX. With this release, you may now import packages and update the version of packages created outside of AutoRABIT.\


<figure><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/import%20packages.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[**Read more →**](../../../product-guides/arm/import-an-unlocked-managed-package.md)

**Dev Hub management**

With this update, users will see all of the packages in their dev hub in the record view. You may expand each package to show the package's versions in order and package data such as version name, version number, ancestor version, ancestor dependencies, etc.

#### 3. Step-based rollback <a href="#id-3-stepbased-rollback" id="id-3-stepbased-rollback"></a>

The option to list the API-supported and unsupported API components is added to the CI job/deployment rollback. If such components may be deployed to the target environment but do not have API support to delete them, ARM will display them individually as unsupported API types. Take, for example, **RecordType**.

The **RecordType** component may be deployed to the target environment, but it cannot be removed; instead, we need to connect to the target Salesforce environment to deactivate the component.\

### Enhancements <a href="#enhancements" id="enhancements"></a>

#### 1. Checkmarx upgrade to v9.4.1 <a href="#id-1-checkmarx-upgrade-to-v941" id="id-1-checkmarx-upgrade-to-v941"></a>

Checkmarx has been updated to version **9.4.1**. Earlier, Checkmarx used a username/password-based authentication method. Now, the user will be able to use token-based authentication with the Checkmarx upgrade.

#### 2. Export all users <a href="#id-2-export-all-users" id="id-2-export-all-users"></a>

The **Export All Users** feature allows the org admins to export a CSV file of all the users currently in their account. We now have added the following fields to the existing CSV file:

* CreatedDate
* CreatedByName
* DeativatedDate
* LastLoginDate
* DeactivatedByName
* LastModifiedDate
*   LastModifiedByName.\


    <figure><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/export%20all%20users.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[**Read more →**](../../../product-guides/arm/arm-administration/user-management/users-roles-and-permissions.md)

#### 3. Pull request support for Azure cloud repositories <a href="#id-3-pull-request-support-for-azure-cloud-repositories" id="id-3-pull-request-support-for-azure-cloud-repositories"></a>

We have extended the support of having the pull request support in the CI Job for the Azure repository. This feature was previously available for Github cloud/Enterprise and Bitbucket cloud/Enterprise; however, we've added support for Azure cloud repositories (DX and non-DX repositories) with this release.

#### 4. Merge/commit approval eligibility <a href="#id-4-mergecommit-approval-eligibility" id="id-4-mergecommit-approval-eligibility"></a>

If you want to make sure one or more people approve every commit or merge, you can enforce this workflow by using merge/commit approvals. These approvals allow you to set the number of necessary approvals to approve every commit/ merge in a project.

The org admins' eligibility level has been enhanced with the ARM 22.1 version. If you're an administrator, you will have the privilege to approve self-merge even if the criteria to self-approve a merge is set to FALSE. This permission will be denied to all members of your team except the org admin. To put it another way, no criteria can restrict an org administrator from approving any EZ-commit/ EZ-Merge.\


<figure><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/commit-merge%20approval.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### 5. CodeScan additional metadata support <a href="#id-5-codescan-additional-metadata-support" id="id-5-codescan-additional-metadata-support"></a>

We have enhanced the scope for analysis of what CodeScan does by adding support for additional metadata and rules. For our ARM users who want to incorporate the SCA tool into their subscriptions, CodeScan would be their first choice as it now supports more robust integrations.

Below is the list of CodeScan supported metadata types:

|                                   |                         |                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Apex Triggers                     | Apex Classes            | Aura Definition Bundles |
| Lightning Component Bundles (LWC) | Visualforce Pages       | Custom Object           |
| Settings                          | Flows                   | Workflows               |
| Profiles                          | Sharing Rules           | Sharing Criteria Rules  |
| Sharing Owner Rules               | Sharing Territory Rules | Permission Sets         |

#### 6. SFDX CLI update <a href="#id-6-sfdx-cli-update" id="id-6-sfdx-cli-update"></a>

The SFDX CLI has been upgraded to the latest stable **7.134** version.

Key characteristics to look for:

* Single deployment request for constructive and destructive changes
* Quick deploy and rollbacks work for both constructive and destructive changes
* Package preparation has been improved.

***

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* The jquery-UI version has been upgraded to **v1.13.0** to fix security issues. Upgrading to the most recent version of jquery makes our application more secure and potentially faster in script execution and loading.
* Minor performance, bug fixes, and security improvements can also be observed in the ARM portal.
