# Enterprise Git Connections

In CodeScan, **Enterprise Git Connections** enable organizations to securely integrate with self-hosted or enterprise instances of **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket**. Admins can configure these connections at the organization level using OAuth credentials and define allowed IP ranges for secure access. Once connected, these integrations streamline project onboarding by allowing users to directly link Git repositories during project setup for automated analysis and CI/CD workflows.
