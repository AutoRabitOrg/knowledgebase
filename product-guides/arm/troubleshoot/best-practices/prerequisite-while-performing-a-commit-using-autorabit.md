# Prerequisites for Performing a Commit Using AutoRABIT

Complete the following steps before starting a commit operation in AutoRABIT:

1. **Register Your Version Control Repository**
   - Only an administrator can perform this step.
   - Register your version control system (e.g., **Git**, **SVN**, or **TFS**) in AutoRABIT.

2. **Register Your Salesforce Organization**
   - Connect AutoRABIT to your Salesforce Org using **OAuth** or **username/password** authentication.
   - This step requires admin-level access.

3. **Set Up a Branch**
   - Create a feature branch to isolate changes instead of editing the main code base directly.
   - This operation must be performed by an administrator.

4. **Map Users to Version Control and Salesforce Orgs**
   - In the **My Profile** section, map users to the registered Salesforce Orgs and version control repositories.
   - Assign necessary permissions to allow project creation in AutoRABIT.
