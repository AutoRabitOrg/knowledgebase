# Failed to push some refs to \[remote]

## Error message: Failed to push some refs to \[remot&#x65;**]**

This error typically happens when you try to push to a remote repository, but your local branch is behind the remote branch. You need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository before you can push your changes.

## Error message: Failed to push some refs to \[remote]. Updates were rejected.

This error usually occurs when you try to push a commit to a target branch, but the `HEAD` has been updated by someone else after you started your merge. You need to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository using **git fetch** and then merge them into your local branch using **git merge** before attempting to push again. You **canâ€™t re-push** because:

* Your merge commit references an **older state** of the target branch.
* Re-pushing would **skip** newer commits, which could cause lost work or conflicts.

You need to **re-perform the merge** using the latest version of the target branch.
