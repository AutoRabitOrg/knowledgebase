# Adding New Users

Inviting colleagues to AutoRABIT (ARM) lets them run commits, deployments, and CI jobs under their own accounts—so actions are tracked to the right person, and permissions stay aligned with their role.  
Only **Org Administrators** can create or modify users.

4. Complete **User Details** and assign a **Role Permission Set** that matches the person’s responsibilities.  
5. Choose one of the activation options:  
   * **Save & Activate** – sends the invitation email immediately.  
   * **Save Now & Activate Later** – save the profile and activate at a future time.

## FAQ

### Can an AutoRABIT login username be changed after it has been created? <a href="#is-it-possible-to-change-the-username-for-the-autorabit-login-after-it-has-been-created" id="is-it-possible-to-change-the-username-for-the-autorabit-login-after-it-has-been-created"></a>

No. Usernames and emails are locked once the account is created. To correct either field:

1. **Delete** the old account (Admins: remove the user from the list).  
2. **Create** a new account with the correct username/email.  
3. Reassign the same **roles and permissions**.
