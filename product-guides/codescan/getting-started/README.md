{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note:** If you are in a region _**other than the US**_, such as _Australia_, change the URL to [**https://app-aus.codescan.io/sessions/new?return to=/%2F**](https://app-aus.codescan.io/sessions/new?returnto=/%2F).\
Similarly, edit the URL for the _EU_ region to [**https://app-eu.codescan.io/sessions/new?return to=/%2F**](https://app-eu.codescan.io/sessions/new?returnto=/%2F).
{% endhint %}

3. Click on **`Log in with AuthO`**.

You cannot make changes to your two-factor authentication after signup. Please contact [support@codescan.io](https://support@codescan.io/) to make changes to your two-factor authentication.
{% endhint %}

### Two-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) <a href="#twofactor-authentication-mfa2fa" id="twofactor-authentication-mfa2fa"></a>

CodeScan offers MFA/2FA to further support account privacy and security. This document helps you understand how to set up and work with 2FA.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Be sure to save the token generated at signup, as it allows you to reset the 2FA if you have trouble logging in or getting push notifications.
{% endhint %}

1. When you [sign up to CodeScan cloud](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan-getting-started#signing-up-with-codescan), you can enable two-factor authentication by selecting the **`Require Two-Factor Authentication`** checkbox.

### Getting Started with CodeScan Cloud <a href="#getting-started-with-codescan-cloud" id="getting-started-with-codescan-cloud"></a>

There are three steps to get CodeScan Cloud working for you.&#x20;

1. Defining Your Standards&#x20;
2. Achieving Visibility&#x20;
3. Enforcing Your Standards

The following sections will include links to articles to help you set up CodeScan through these three steps.

#### Defining Your Standards <a href="#defining-your-standards" id="defining-your-standards"></a>

CodeScan comes out-of-the-box with some predefined rule sets. These represent our recommended minimums for your security and quality.

However, these rule sets are completely customizable. Define what you would like to see and how important it is by creating your own custom rule sets. [Click here to learn how customizable rule](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/customising-quality-profiles).

Defining an expected level of quality is also very important. The highest-level quality indicator of your code is a hard pass or fail. [Click here to learn how to set these standards](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/customising-quality-gates).

#### Achieving Visibility <a href="#achieving-visibility" id="achieving-visibility"></a>

CodeScan helps you keep your code clean as you develop using the branching functionality and new code periods.

Seeing the issues as they appear allows you to maintain your standards on current development and plan your refactoring efforts. See here for more information on [Branching Functionality](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/understanding-branches-in-codescan-cloud) and the [New Code](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/understanding-the-new-code-tab) tab.

#### Enforcing Your Standards <a href="#enforcing-your-standards" id="enforcing-your-standards"></a>

Passing or failing a project on the CodeScan dashboard is very useful. The next step is to use those metrics to enforce your standards. Learn how [CodeScan can be integrated into your repository or pipeline with our articles around CI/CD](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan-integration-with-autorabit).

**Enjoy cleaner code!**
