#### What is a Package Version? <a href="#what-is-a-package-version" id="what-is-a-package-version"></a>

A package is a container for Salesforce metadata. It represents a distinct deployable unit of functionality that is iterated over time. You can add metadata to a package and take a snapshot of it, anytime. This snapshot is called a package version. You can create package versions any number of times. Each package version, once created, is immutable and is associated with a single package. You can install a package version in any Salesforce environment - scratch orgs, sandbox orgs, or production orgs. Installing a package version deploys the metadata that was specified when the package version was created.

1. Click on the **+** icon under the **Actions** tab to create a version for your package.

2. Next, fill in the below details:
   * **Version Name**: Version name gets auto-generated based on the package name. However, you can edit the name and enter your desired name. It is really up to you.
   * **Version Number**: Version numbers are formatted as "major.minor.patch.build". _**For ex-**_ _1.2.1.8_.
   * **Installation Key**: Enter the installation key that protects your package from being installed by unauthorized individuals.
   * **Tag**: Enter the tag that is required to release the package. _**For ex-** Release 1.0.0_
   * **Version Description**: Brief description of your package version.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Verify the log status in the **Package Log** screen.
