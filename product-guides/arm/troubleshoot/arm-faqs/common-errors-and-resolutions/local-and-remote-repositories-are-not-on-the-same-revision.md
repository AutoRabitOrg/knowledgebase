# Local and remote repositories are not on the same revision

## Error message: Local and remote repositories are not on the same revision

There are several possible explanations for AutoRABIT to throw an error **"local and remote repo is not on same revision"**:

1. The local repository is out of date.
2. The branch that contains the commit was deleted, so the commit is no longer referenced.
3. Someone force-pushed the commit.
