## Subscription Management: Overview <a href="#subscription-management-overview" id="subscription-management-overview"></a>

ARM offers an easy and centralized solution for a **Registered User** of your organization to manage team subscriptions and accounts. This ensures tracking of all subscription activity, ensuring everything is logged, and nothing is lost. You use the **Subscription Management (SM)** interface to review and manage how purchased subscriptions are used on your production instance.

### Procedure <a href="#procedure" id="procedure"></a>

1. Log in to your ARM account using the **Registered User** credentials.&#x20;
2. Hover your mouse over the **`Admin`** tab and click on **`Subscriptions`**.

    * **`Total Subscriptions:`** Number of licenses purchased by the organization. Only the Registered User of your organization can view the Subscription Management section.&#x20;
    * **`Total Subscription Allotted:`** Number of licenses utilized to date.

## Managing Licenses for Enterprise Users <a href="#managing-licenses-for-enterprise-users" id="managing-licenses-for-enterprise-users"></a>

As an _Account Administrator_ for your ARM account, you can manage the user licenses you have subscribed to for your organization.

#### Purchase Additional User Licenses <a href="#purchase-additional-user-licenses" id="purchase-additional-user-licenses"></a>

You must submit a support ticket to purchase extra licenses for your organization. Our Customer Success (CS) team will provide you with a new license key, which you must upload to the **Subscription Management** page.

**Step 1: Upload License Key**

Navigate to **`Admin > Subscription Management`** once you've received the license key file from us. You'll see a summary of the _Total Subscription_ count, _Total Subscription Allotted_ so far, and _Total Subscription Available_ (which can be assigned to a user or team).&#x20;

Click on **`Choose File`** and upload the **`license key`** (.l4j file format). Click **`Upload`**.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (717).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The total subscription counts will be changed based on the user's license specified in the key.

ErrorIf an incorrect file is selected, a notification popup stating that the file is incorrect is displayed. Click on the **Reset** button and select the correct file.

**Step 2: Updating Allotted Subscriptions**

After uploading the license key, the administrator can allot the available subscriptions to the desired team.

1. Look for the desired team on the **Subscription Management** page.
2. Then, under the **`Actions`** tab, click on the **Edit (**![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (718).png>)**)** icon to update the subscription count for a team.

3. The number of user licenses available for your account is displayed in the **`Subscriptions Available`** field.
4. In the **`Team Subscriptions`** section, click on the **`-`** or **`+`** buttons to update the license count, then click **`Save`**.
