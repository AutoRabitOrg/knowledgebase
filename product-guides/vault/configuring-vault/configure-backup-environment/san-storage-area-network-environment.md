# SAN (Storage Area Network) Environment

#### SAN (Storage Area Network) Environment <a href="#san-storage-area-network-environment" id="san-storage-area-network-environment"></a>

SAN provides server access to data stored at the block level, so that storage devices seem locally attached to the operating system. These storage devices that form part of the SAN are usually not accessible to other devices on the wider local area network (LAN). Although a SAN provides only block-level operations, shared-disk file systems can be built on top of SANs to provide file-level access.

For configuring to SAN environment, you need to fill in two important fields:

1. &#x20;Enter a **label** of your choice, and
2. Enter the **SAN path**. Each path is defined and identified by these two endpoints: the host server on one end and the storage volume or share on the other.

Once the environment is successfully configured, you can start using [Vault](https://www.autorabit.com/products/vault-data-backup-recovery/) anywhere, anytime.
