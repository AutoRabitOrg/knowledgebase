# Extract Salesforce Data

The following articles describe using **Single Dataloader** to extract data from Salesforce. The information is stored in CSV format.

1. Log in to your ARM account.
2. Hover your mouse over the [**`Dataloader`**](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/10-benefits-of-salesforce-data-loader/) module and select **`Dataloader`**.The **Dataloader** screen is best viewed when the zoom setting is **75%** on your Chrome/Firefox browser.
3. Click **`Extract`** on the right side of the screen.

4. Choose your [**`Salesforce org`**](../../../arm-administration/registration/salesforce-org/) and your org **`Environment`** (_Production_ or _Development_ edition, _Sandbox_, or _Pre-Release_).
5. The corresponding **`URL`** and your **`Username`** are automatically generated based on the above selection.
6. Click **`Login and Fetch objects`** to fetch all the objects from your Salesforce org.
7. Select the object from which you wish to extract the data. For example, **Account**, **Contact**, **Lead**, etc. You can use the **`Search`** function to search through your objects and  **`filter`** to filter your standard/custom objects quickly.
8. Click **`Next`**.

9. On the left, you will be provided with an option to select related objects and their fields. Each object will be displayed as a collapsible unit, under which you can select either all of the fields or required fields. Use the **`Quick Find`** search function to search through your fields quickly.

10. Select the checkbox before each field to include for the extraction process.

11. On the right, you can add **`Filters`** to your query. Specifying the filter criteria will extract records within a specified limit. To add filters to your query:

    * For your object _(example- Account)_ selected, choose a **`field`** _(example- CreatedDate)._
    * Select the **`operator`**.
    * Enter the **`filter value`** _(example- Date Literals, Last\_week)_.
    * Click on the **+** icon to add the filter.&#x20;
    * To delete a filter, click on the **x** icon.

12. In the **`Order By`** section, you can assign the order in which the record is generated, i.e., ascending or descending order.

    * Select a **`field`** to be your sorting criteria.
    * Select your sorting order: **`Ascending`** or **`Descending`**.

13. You can verify your query using the **`Validate Query`** button to ensure it will work properly before running your task. The number of records being extracted is shown as a notification pop-up.

14. On the **`Process Summary`** screen, you can:
    * Give the process/job a **`Name`**.
    * Select the **`Category`**. Categories are used to classify and group similar processes having similar functionality. In simple terms, you are assigning similar processes to a category. You can select an existing category or create a new one by clicking the **`+`** icon.
    * View the main **`Object`**.
    * View the operation **`Type`** (**`Extract`**).
    * View the number of extracted **`Records`**.
    * **`Limit`** the export row count. Use this option to retrieve some rows from your export results.&#x20;
    * **`Use Bulk API`**.About Bulk APIThe **Bulk API** is based on REST principles and is optimized for inserting, updating, and deleting large data sets. You can use the **Bulk API** to process jobs in **serial** or **parallel** mode. Processing batches serially means running them one after another, while processing batches in parallel means running multiple batches simultaneously. When you run a bulk API job, processing more batches in parallel means giving that job a higher degree of parallelism, providing better overall data throughput.
15. You can schedule your tasks so they start running regularly. You can choose between **`Daily`**, **`Weekly`**, or **`On-demand`** schedules.
16. Finally, click **`Save`** to save your task and run it later.

17. Your task is shown on top of the lists on the **`Dataloader Summary`** screen.
18. Click **`Run`** to start the dataloader immediately before the scheduled time.

19. Select the configurations here:
    * **Use Batch Size** whenever the Bulk API checkbox is left unchecked, the Batch API is used.
    * **Salesforce Batch API** is based on SOAP principles and is optimized for real-time client applications that update small numbers of records at a time. Although SOAP API can also process larger numbers of records, it becomes less practical when the data sets contain hundreds of thousands of records. In such cases, **Bulk API** is the best option. **Batch API** processes data in smaller batches than bulk API, resulting in a higher API call usage per operation on large volumes of data.
    * **Limit** the export row count.
    * **Use UTF-8 file encoding for file read and write operations**.
20. Click **`Run`**.

21. The **`Results of Last Run`** section shows the number of successful or failed records extracted. You can view the records or download them to your local system. The records are generated in ZIP format.
