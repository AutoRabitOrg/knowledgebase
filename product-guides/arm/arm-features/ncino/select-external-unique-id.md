# Select External Unique ID

## **Select External Unique Identifier During nCino Feature Deployment**

This provision allows you to go through the list of external unique IDs available and will allow you to select the external unique ID of your choice.

1\.       By default, the ID, Name, and a unique field will be populated in the dropdown.

2\.       If the name is auto generated, then that name will not be considered a unique field.

The external unique ID field is available in the “Deploy” page.

If the source for the deployment is a CSV file, then all the fields will be displayed in the dropdowns.
