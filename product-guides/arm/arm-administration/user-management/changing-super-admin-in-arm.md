# Changing Super Admin in ARM

We are thrilled to announce that you can easily change your super admin with our new 23.1 release.

With the new 23.1 release, weâ€™ve consolidated the roles of Super Admin and Registered Admin into a single empowered Admin role. But also with the new 23.1 release, we have added a new feature so you can assign the ex-Super admin from your login.

Please follow the simple steps below.

1. Log in with your Admin credentials. Go to the Users section in the Admin panel.
2. From the User tab, you will see the \* symbol next to the current super admin name. Click on the Edit icon.
3. Edit the Previous super admin user, remove the admin access, and give another role.
4. Once it's done, save the changes. You will get a confirmation window about the new Super Admin on the next page. Log out and log in again.
