### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

This article describes the basic configuration of a proxy server. You will learn how to pass a request from Vault to proxied servers over different protocols, and modify request headers that are sent to the proxied server.

Vault sends the proxy details in the request headers whenever getting connected to an outside customer network.
