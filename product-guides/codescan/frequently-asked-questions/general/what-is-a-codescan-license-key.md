# What is a CodeScan License Key?

A CodeScan license key is provided to you when signing up for a [CodeScan Self-Hosted](https://www.codescan.io/products/self-hosted/) trial or upon purchase/renewal of a CodeScan license.

The key is provided as a string of characters used when [Installing CodeScan Self-Hosted](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/codescan-self-hosted) or downloading CodeScan plugins in the absence of a [Subscription Key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-subscription-code).

If you do not know your **License Key** or have misplaced it, please contact [support@codescan.io](mailto:support@codescan.io).
