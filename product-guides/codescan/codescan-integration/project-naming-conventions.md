# Project Naming Conventions

The name of the project is often configured at the time of analysis, so changing it depends on where the project is being analyzed from.

For Copado projects, this is configured by Copado and it takes the Copado Project name. The analysis of a Copado project is actually done on the Copado side using CodeScan.

Any change to the name of a Copado project needs to be sent by Copado with their analysis parameters.

For GitHub Actions Projects, this can be configured in the analysis parameters in the workflow file.

For projects created in CodeScan, you can use the Projects Analysis page and click 'Edit Project.'
