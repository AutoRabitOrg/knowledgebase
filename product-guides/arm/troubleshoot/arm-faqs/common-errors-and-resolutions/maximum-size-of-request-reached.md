This error may be due to a file size limitation. We suggest you break deployments down into smaller chunks to be successful. Please refer to the Salesforce article below about the file size limits for deployments: [Salesforce Developers](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_metadata.htm).
