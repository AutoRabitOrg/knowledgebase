# Error: "Authentication Failed"

### Description

When selecting an ALM on the EZ-Commit screen, ARM displays the error: **"Authentication Failed."**

### Cause

* VPN connectivity appears to be the source of intermittent ALM connectivity issues.
* ALM is wrongly configured

### Resolution

1. On the **My Account** screen, look for the ALM configuration. To reauthenticate your ALM configuration, click the **Test Connection** icon to verify your credentials.
2. If the steps above do not work, create a new credential and link it to your ALM account.
