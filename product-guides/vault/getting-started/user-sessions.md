# User Sessions

A new feature released by [Vault](https://www.autorabit.com/products/vault-data-backup-recovery/) allows the administrator to view a list of all the currently active users in the Vault.

{% hint style="info" %}
Vault admins can view all user sessions for an org; non-admins see only their own sessions.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In addition to viewing all active sessions, the administrator can terminate any active session. This will automatically log the user out of the Vault. To do this, the administrator has to navigate to the **Profile > Session Information**.

Here the administrator can select any required user session and click on **Logout** to terminate that user’s session. The user will be automatically logged out from the organization as soon as the administrator clicks **Logout**.

When the admin manually ends a user’s session, the user must log in again to the Vault.&#x20;

The following table contains information about the fields you can view on this page. Due to the nature of geolocation technology, the accuracy of geolocation fields may vary.&#x20;
