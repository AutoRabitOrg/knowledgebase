# Project reports are not available for branches created outside the CodeScan Cloud

**Error:** “Project reports are not available for branches created outside the CodeScan Cloud.”

**Reason:** For branches created outside the CodeScan Cloud, such as _ARM_, _Flosum_, or _Copado_, project reports are not yet accessible. Only the branch chosen during the initial integration setup with the CodeScan Ccloud can have reports fetched in CodeScan.

**Workaround:** In the **Edit Project** section, select **“Attach Analysis Project,”** and choose project type as **“Webhook.”** After this step, project reports will be accessible.
