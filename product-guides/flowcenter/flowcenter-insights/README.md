### What is FlowCenter Insights (Beta)?

FlowCenter is an umbrella term that groups different capabilities that bring visibility into your DevOps process. **Insights** is one of those specific capabilities, which is our reports and dashboards product.

With **Insights**, you will get full visibility of the most important metrics such as deployment frequency, common deployment errors, etc. Use this information to make important decisions about how your team is using AutoRABIT and how they can get the most out of it.
