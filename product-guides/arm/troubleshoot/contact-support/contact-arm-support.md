# Contact ARM Support

ARM was designed to be easy to use and intuitive to learn, but there may be times when you have questions as you're getting started with a new tool. If that happens, AutoRABIT is here to help.

If you need help, the first step is to look for information in the AutoRABIT Help Center. You’ll find wide-ranging documentation on ARM and its features, knowledge bytes, best practices, and frequently asked questions (FAQs).
