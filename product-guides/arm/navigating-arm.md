Let's examine each of these links in detail:

#### [Dashboard](dashboards-and-widgets.md) <a href="#dashboard" id="dashboard"></a>

The ARM Dashboards enable you to display multiple performance analytics, reporting, and other widgets on a single screen. ARM includes pre-defined widgets that can be customized and displayed on the Classic Dashboards page. These widgets are displayed as graphs, tables, and text. Each user can choose the widgets to populate their dashboard.

#### [Version Control (VC)](arm-features/version-control/introduction-to-version-control/) <a href="#version-control-vc" id="version-control-vc"></a>

Version control helps you track changes you make in your code over time. Using a version control system, you can create snapshots of your code by creating branches or copies and isolating the codebase from the central repository. Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed or enhancements introduced by the change. This makes it easier to make changes and enhances the overall quality of the code.\
A list of action items related to the Version Control system will get displayed, such as EZ-Commit, Merge, Manage Labels, etc.

#### [Continuous Integration Job (CI Job)](automation-and-ci.md) <a href="#continuous-integration-job-ci-job" id="continuous-integration-job-ci-job"></a>

ARM's Continuous Integration (CI) is designed to help customers rapidly release code confidently by automating the build, test, and deployment process to accomplish Continuous Delivery for Salesforce. CI encourages developers to share their code and unit tests by merging their changes into a shared version control repository upon completing every task. You can release code faster as it allows you to track application development and metadata modifications.

#### [Deployment](deployment.md) <a href="#deployment" id="deployment"></a>

The **Deployment** process allows you to quickly and safely transfer new developments from your sandbox instance to a production instance. You can transfer validation rules, custom objects, new fields, apex codes, and many other components from your development environment to a live production environment using the deployment process.

#### [Dataloader](dataloader.md) <a href="#dataloader" id="dataloader"></a>

ARM Data Loader allows you to configure your data loading operations in convenient and user-friendly GUI wizards and even allows importing and exporting Salesforce data without typing a line of code. Its powerful and easy-to-understand scheduling settings will enable you to specify almost any schedule quickly. You may schedule any data-loading operation for automatic execution.

#### [Test Automation Factory (TAF)](taf-workflow.md) <a href="#test-automation-factory-taf" id="test-automation-factory-taf"></a>

Test Automation Factory or TAF is a semi-automated functional test automation framework built into the ARM suite that can accelerate the test automation effort and reduce the cost of test automation by 75% of what will incur with traditional programming-driven/IDE (Integrated Development Environment) driven test automation.

#### [Salesforce-DX (SFDX)](salesforce-dx.md) <a href="#salesforcedx-sfdx" id="salesforcedx-sfdx"></a>

Salesforce Developer Experience (DX) is a new set of tools that streamlines the entire development life cycle. It improves team development and collaboration, facilitates automated testing and continuous integration, and makes the release cycle more efficient and agile. Itâ€™s a new approach that supports team collaboration, focusing on predictability, quality, and standardized development life-cycle on Salesforce. Salesforce DX enables developers to build and release the latest features in a short period with minimal risk. ARM provides the best Salesforce Developer Experience with continuous integration and helps deliver software rapidly.

#### [Reports](reports-overview.md) <a href="#reports" id="reports"></a>

ARM allows its users to view all the deployment, merge, dataloader related information carried out in the Salesforce Org in the form of reports. This information improves productivity, accountability, and insight into your business data in the form of reports.

#### [Environment Provisioning](environment-provisioning.md) <a href="#environment-provisioning" id="environment-provisioning"></a>

Environment Provisioning is a unique interface ARM provides to quickly facilitate a Salesforce sandbox with metadata and data requirements that suit specific needs. These can be created as a template and stored in ARM. The same templates can be reused multiple times across various modules in ARM. For example, you can create an Environment Provisioning template to disable validation rules, enable history tracking, anonymous Apex, etc., of a particular object as a post-deployment setup.

#### [Admin](broken-reference) <a href="#admin" id="admin"></a>

Admin-related items are displayed here, such as registering of Salesforce Org, Version Control, adding team members, etc.

#### [nCino](ncino.md) <a href="#ncino" id="ncino"></a>

nCino-related operations will be displayed in this section, for ex- creating a feature migration template, automating nCino deployments, etc.
