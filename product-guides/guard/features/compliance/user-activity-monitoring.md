# User Activity Monitoring

## Overview

The **User Activity Monitoring** feature provides full visibility into user activity within your Salesforce organization. By consolidating License Usage, Profiles, and account statuses into a single dashboard, it helps administrators ensure proper Access Management, optimize licensing, and maintain Compliance.

## Key Benefits

* **Centralized User Insights**: View all Salesforce users in one organized dashboard.
* **License Optimization**: Identify unused or underutilized licenses.
* **Security Oversight**: Monitor account status (active, frozen, locked) and password activity.
* **Compliance Support**: Ensure role and profile assignments align with policies.
* **Flexible Reporting**: Export and filter data for deeper analysis.

## Dashboard Overview



* **User Count by Profiles**: A chart showing how many users are assigned to which Profiles, making it easy to spot overuse or misallocation.
* **License Utilization Chart**: Visual breakdown of Used vs. Unused licenses for optimization.
* **Users Table**: A detailed list of all Salesforce users, including:
  * Name, Email, Username
  * License Type
  * Profile & Role
  * User Status (Active/Frozen)
  * Password Status (Locked)
  * Last Modified Date

### Filtering and Exporting

You can refine your view using filters to focus on specific categories, such as:

* Profile
* Role
* Active or Frozen status
* Password lock status
* Last modified date
* Last login date
* Last password change

Filtered views make it easier to investigate anomalies or prepare compliance reports.

The **Export** option lets you download the user table directly for audits, governance reviews, or internal reporting.

**Tip:** Schedule periodic reviews of your User activity dashboard to strengthen security posture and maintain compliance without waiting for audit cycles.

## Example scenarios

1. **Review Profiles Regularly**: Ensure Profiles aren’t over-assigned to users who don’t require those permissions.
2. **Check License Utilization**: Free up unused licenses to optimize costs.
3. **Monitor Users' Status**: Quickly identify inactive or frozen accounts and take appropriate action.
4. **Audit Login Activity**: Use last login and password change data to detect inactive or potentially risky accounts.
