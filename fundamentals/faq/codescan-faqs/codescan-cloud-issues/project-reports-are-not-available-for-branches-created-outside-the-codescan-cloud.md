**Reason:** For branches created outside the CodeScan Cloud, such as _ARM_, _Flosum_, or _Copado_, project reports are not yet accessible. Only the branch chosen during the initial integration setup with CodeScan Cloud can have reports fetched in CodeScan.

**Workaround:** In the **Edit Project** section, select **“Attach Analysis Project,”** and choose the project type as **“Webhook.”**&#x20;
