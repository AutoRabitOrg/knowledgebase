# EZ-Merge

### What is EZ-Merge? <a href="#what-is-ezmerge" id="what-is-ezmerge"></a>

Merging is simply putting a forked history back together again. Say you have a new branch feature based on the master branch. You now want to merge this feature branch into the master. Using the merge process in ARM will merge the specified branch feature into the current branch...we'll assume the master.&#x20;

### Before you begin <a href="#before-you-begin" id="before-you-begin"></a>

Before a merge, there are several preparation steps you must take to ensure the merge goes smoothly. Most of these steps must be performed by an Admin.

1. [**`Register your Version Control Repository in ARM`**](../introduction-to-version-control/version-control-repositories-summary.md)**`:`** Only an Admin can perform this step. Register your Version Control Repositories, such as GIT, SVN, or TFS, in ARM.&#x20;
2. [**`Register your Salesforce Organization in ARM`**](../../../arm-administration/registration/salesforce-org/)**`:`** ARM connects to your Salesforce Org using the secure OAuth method or username/password connections. Only an Admin can perform this step.&#x20;
3. [**`Set Up a Branch`**](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/product-guides/arm/getting-started/registration/version-control-branch/git-branch-creation#overview)**`:`** Instead of making changes directly to the code base, you can branch off from the main line and work on a specific feature in an isolated branch. Only an Admin can perform this step.&#x20;
4. [**`Mapping the users with the Version Control and Salesforce Orgs`**](../../../arm-administration/user-management/view-my-profile.md) **`in the "My Profile" section:`** Set up the permissions to create a project in ARM.&#x20;
5. **`Fetch the latest remote commits:`** Ensure the receiving branch and the merging branch are up-to-date with the latest remote changes.

### How do I merge my changes to a branch? <a href="#how-do-i-merge-my-changes-to-a-branch" id="how-do-i-merge-my-changes-to-a-branch"></a>

The merge process is generally performed when a feature is ready for user testing in Salesforce Orgs and usually involves code review by other development team members.

<mark style="color:blue;">**Important Note**</mark>**:** The merge process in ARM remains valid for **seven days**. Make sure you resolve the merge conflicts (if any) for your merge label and commit the changes to another branch within **seven days** or the merge expires. All merge-related reports such as Static Code Analysis reports, Deployment Validation reports, or Difference reports generated also expire after **seven days**.

1. Hover your mouse over the [**`Version Control`**](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/7-tips-for-salesforce-version-control-integration/) module and select **`Commits.`**

4. In the **`New EZ-Merge`** screen, select the **`version control repository`** from where the metadata components will be fetched.
5. Select your **`source (base) branch`** and the **`target (destination) branch`**.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Source &#x26; Target Branches</p></figcaption></figure>

6.  Select the **`Merge Type`** from the dropdown:

    * `Entire Branch`&#x20;
    * `Single Revision`
    * `Commit Label`
    * `Release Label`
    * `ALM Label`

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="431"><figcaption><p>Merge Type</p></figcaption></figure>

### Merge Type <a href="#merge-type" id="merge-type"></a>

**A. Entire Branch**

This option will merge the entire change from one branch to another branch.&#x20;

**Different options for `"Entire Branch"` merge type**&#x20;

* **`Delete Source Branch:`** Once you have successfully merged the changes from the source branch to another, you can permanently delete the source branch. Select the **`Delete Source Branch`** checkbox to delete the source branch, which auto-populates whenever 'Entire Branch' as a merge type is selected.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Delete Source Branch</p></figcaption></figure>

**B. Single Revision**

Merge a Single Revision from the Commits that you have performed. You can either enter the revision number (in case you remember it) or use the **`Search`** (![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)) button next to the **`Single Revision`** field to pull a list of revisions from which you can choose the revision to use in the deployment.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="440"><figcaption><p>New Merge</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: You will not have the option to enter the work item details manually, you need to select the work item from the list fetched.
{% endhint %}

3. Select one of the work items from the list fetched, and click **OK**.

### EZ-Merge Process Stages

1. **Merge Initiated:** This stage marks the beginning of the merge process. It indicates that a merge operation has been triggered, and the system is preparing to consolidate or merge data.
2. **Awaiting User Action**: During this stage, the system is waiting for user input or action. Users may be required to review and confirm merge decisions, resolve conflicts, or provide additional information before the process proceeds.
3. **Commit Generated**: The commit generation stage involves creating changes or transactions that will be applied to the system once the user confirms the merge. It represents the proposed changes resulting from the merge operation.
4. **Validating Salesforce XML**:  This stage involves checking and validating the Salesforce XML (eXtensible Markup Language) files associated with the merge. It ensures that the data conforms to the expected format and requirements, preventing issues during the merge.
5. **Duplicate Access Settings**: This stage involves checking and managing access settings for potential duplicates. It ensures that security and access controls are appropriately configured for the merged data.
6. **Generating Delta**: The delta generation involves identifying the changes or differences between the original data and the updated data resulting from the merge. This information is crucial for understanding the impact of the merge on the existing records.
7. **Pending User Approval**: In this stage, the system has completed the necessary preparations, and the merge changes are pending final approval from the user. Users may review and confirm or reject the proposed changes based on their assessment.
8. **Green Checkmark (**<mark style="color:green;">**✓**</mark>**)**: A green checkmark indicates a process or operation has been completed. It confirms that the task, such as a data merge or deployment, has been executed without errors and meets the required criteria.
9. **Red Cross Mark (**<mark style="color:red;">**X**</mark>**):** On the other hand, the appearance of a red cross mark (<mark style="color:red;">**X**</mark>) signifies that a process has encountered an issue or has failed to complete successfully. This could be due to various reasons, such as validation errors, data conflicts, or system issues. Users should investigate the details of the failure to identify and address the issue.&#x20;

### &#x20;Conflict Resolution

1. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**: This field allows you to select how to resolve the conflicts. If you and another user change the same file in different sandboxes or on different branches, a conflict arises when you try to commit your modified files. When the conflict occurs, ARM will use the below resolve method:
   * **Manually resolve conflicts**: Resolve the conflicts manually.
   * **Choose the file from the source**: Replaces the copy of the file in your workspace with the version in the repo, discarding your changes.&#x20;
   * **Choose the file from the destination**: Accept the file in your workspace, overwriting the version in the repo when you submit the file.
2. Enter the **Merge Label name** and **comment** (if any).
3. Enter the **Email ID(s)** to send an email notification of the merge reports.
4. **Create Commit Label:** To create a commit label for the merge operation, select this checkbox. Choose the **Salesforce** or **Vlocity** commit label type from the drop-down menu.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (18) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="360"><figcaption><p>Commit Label</p></figcaption></figure>

5. **Create a GIT Tag:** GIT tags are a simple and effective way to ensure you can keep track of the different versions of your code and the critical quality of Git's version control. GIT Tag operation allows meaningful names to a specific version in the repository.
6. **Skip Layout/Profile/Perm. Set Access-Setting Duplicity Check:** If you do not want ARM to list all duplicate entries for your layout/profile/permission sets, please select this checkbox. ([Learn More](merge-conflicts.md))
7. **Review Artifact:** Select this checkbox to see the list of the changed files staged for commit (during merge conflicts). This allows you to preview the changes, review them or edit the files before pushing them into your version control. ([Learn More](merge-conflicts.md))

## Skip Pre-validation Criteria for Back-Merge Branches

1.  **Select the Skip Pre-Validation for Back-Merge Checkbox**:

    * Navigate to **Merge Settings** under the **Admin** section.
    * Select the **Skip Pre-Validation for Back-Merge** checkbox.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Merge Settings</p></figcaption></figure>
2. **Perform a New EZ-Merge**:
   * Execute a new EZ-Merge from a higher to a lower branch (e.g., INT to DEV).
3.  **Automatic Skipping of Prevalidation Criteria**:

    * The pre-validation criteria will be automatically skipped during the back-merge process.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Prevalidate Merge</p></figcaption></figure>
4.  **Back Merge Indicator**:

    * After performing the merge, you will see an indicator confirming that the validation is being skipped automatically as it is a back merge.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Back Merge Indicator</p></figcaption></figure>

### Prevalidate Merge <a href="#prevalidate-merge" id="prevalidate-merge"></a>

In this section, you can assign certain pre-validation merge operations before merging to your target branch. These operations include deployment validation with up to three selected Salesforce Orgs, choosing Apex test classes to run, selecting the static code analysis tool, and generating difference reports.

**Prevalidation Merge Options:**

Use these options to customize and control your pre-validation merge operations, ensuring robust and flexible deployment validation tailored to your specific needs:

1. **Deployment Validation with Multiple Salesforce Orgs**:
   * You can now select up to three Salesforce Orgs for deployment validation. This allows for thorough testing across different environments before completing the merge.
2. **Apex Test Class Selection**:
   * You can select separate Apex test classes for each Salesforce Org. This provides the flexibility to run different tests tailored to each environment's needs.
3. **Merge Success Criteria**:
   * **All Orgs Success**: The merge will be successful only if all selected Salesforce Orgs pass the validation. This option ensures that changes are consistently valid across all environments.
   * **Any One Org Success**: The merge will be successful if at least one of the selected Salesforce Orgs passes the validation. This option provides flexibility, allowing the merge to proceed even if some orgs do not validate successfully.
4.  **Skip Members Option**:

    * The skip members option will only be visible if it has been configured. Ensure that this configuration is in place if you intend to use this feature.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Skip Members Option</p></figcaption></figure>

**Different Prevalidate Merge Criteria:**

1. **Generate Diff Report:** Select this option to auto-generate a code difference report on completion of the commit.
2.  **Run Static code Analysis:** Select this option if you want to run a [static code analysis tool](https://www.autorabit.com/products/codescan/) to identify potential software quality issues before the code moves to production. Similar to "**Generate Diff Report,"** this option will also be auto-selected by default if the criteria are set globally (under the **My Account > Commit Validation - Approval Settings** section).

    * For _ApexPMD, Checkmarx, CodeScan,_ and _SonarQube_: ARM allows you to set the criteria for running the SCA tool, whether to run on all supported metadata types from the full source or to run on the newly added components.

    <figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (23) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Prevalidate Merge</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note**: Whenever a code analysis is triggered, ARM will wait up to **5** hours for a response. If the code analysis is not completed within 5 hours, ARM will throw a timeout exception error. This applies to all SCA tools.
{% endhint %}

### Validate Deployment

**Validate Deployment**: Choose a Salesforce org to validate a future deployment. Further, there are different options to choose from:

* **Rollback on error:** This checkbox is selected by default to avoid major deployments. However, you can deselect the checkbox to skip the rollback on error under the validate deploy section in merge pre-validation so that it ignores any errors and deploys the remaining components. This is captured in the **Failed Components** tab of the **Deployment Validation** section on the commit's details page. The deployment status will be captured as **Partially Succeeded**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This checkbox should be selected for Production org deployments.
{% endhint %}

* **Run Destructive Changes:** Here, you can specify whether to run pre- or post-destructive changes while carrying out the merge process.
* **Ignore Missing Visibility:** With this option, differences in visibility settings between the source and destination branches will not cause the merge to fail. ARM will compare the source and destination branches and keep only the common settings between both branches.\
  \
  **Important Note**: **Standard fields** are not supported for **Ignore Missing Visible Settings**.\

* **Ignore installed components:** When selected, ARM will scan for the components that are deployed, and if there are any managed package components located in the destination branch, these components will be excluded from the metadata.zip files while the remaining components are deployed.&#x20;
* **Apex Test Level:** Choose your [Apex Test Level](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/product-guides/arm/arm-features/deployment/apex-unit-tests) to validate your merge.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Apex Test Level</p></figcaption></figure>

* **Apex Test Class selection:**&#x20;

Select Org 1 by clicking on the drop-down of destination:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Org 1 selection</p></figcaption></figure>

Select Org 2 by clicking on the drop-down of destination:

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Org 2 selection</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If your validate deployment fails on an org, it shows an (<mark style="color:red;">**X**</mark>). If it passes, it shows a (<mark style="color:green;">**✓**</mark>).
{% endhint %}

**Points to Remember**:

1. **Prevalidate Merge** section will only be visible if the Admin has enabled the **'Merge Setting'** checkbox under the **My Account** section.&#x20;
2. Users with the **'Merge Review Overridable'** role have special permission to check or uncheck the pre-validate option. However, each time they try to commit to the branch, a notification alert mail gets triggered to the email ID as specified in **My Account > Merge Settings**.&#x20;
3. **Prevalidate Merge** section will not be displayed for Version control repositories registered in the **'SFDX'** structure.
4. Suppose the meta-XML file does not exist in the Destination Branch and is available in the Source Branch. The meta-XML file is copied from the source to the destination branch before committing to the remote repository. The newly added meta-XML file will be added to the files list, committed to the remote repository, and added to the **Validate Deployment** package.
5. Based on the permission assigned by your Admin, you will see the options in the active state. Suppose your Admin has assigned you permission to run a static code analysis tool only to review your code before merging them. In that case, the **Run Static Code Analysis** option will remain inactive, while other options will remain disabled or won't be seen.
6. Based on the Approval Reviewer level set in '**Merge Settings'** (under the **My Account** section), you need to specify the email address of the reviewers for a given proposed code change and to approve merge requests.

### ALM Integration <a href="#alm-integration" id="alm-integration"></a>

You can update the status of the ALM work item through the **ALM Integration** section (below the **Pre-validate Merge** section), and the same gets reflected in your ALM system.

1. Select the **ALM label**.
2. Select the **Project** and the **sprint** for which the commit is planned.
3. Select the **Work Item,** and the **Current Status** for the work item gets auto-populated. This allows you to update the ALM for the Merge operation with or without changing the current work item status. Click on the **+** icon to add another work item and update its status.

### Troubleshooting <a href="#troubleshooting" id="troubleshooting"></a>

For merge labels that are either in progress or have some conflicts, in such a scenario, you will find a popup that will appear as shown below when you press the **Validate & Merge** button. _**These merge conflict statuses will only be shown for the merges created within seven days**._

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>In-Progress Merge Labels</p></figcaption></figure>

**Resolution:** To prevent this, first, resolve current merge conflicts or allow the in-progress merge status to move to the completed state and then restart the merge process again.

### Common Issues with EZ-Merge

#### While performing an EZ-Merge, inaccurate file changes are being merged into the destination branch.

**Issue references in stackoverflow link:** [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63365836/git-is-showing-a-file-as-moved-on-bitbucket-i-want-it-as-a-new-file-for-pull-r](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63365836/git-is-showing-a-file-as-moved-on-bitbucket-i-want-it-as-a-new-file-for-pull-r)

&#x20;**What do I need to do outside of ARM?**

1. Checkout to the target branch.
2. Merge the branch by executing the command shown in the ‘applying merge’ log.
3. Check the results for the modified files.
4. If the result matches the ARM file changes, then this is a Git behavior.

#### Why is a merge getting auto rejected during deployment? <a href="#why-merge-is-getting-auto-rejected-during-deployment" id="why-merge-is-getting-auto-rejected-during-deployment"></a>

Below are the reasons why ARM rejects your merge request:

* It will be auto rejected if the proper **merge criteria** are not enabled. The merge criteria must be enabled before you are performing the jobs.
  * Navigate to **Admin > My Account > Merge Setting** to select the proper merge criteria. Click [Here](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/product-guides/arm/arm-administration/user-management/manage-users-account-settings#id-9-merge-settings) for a more detailed explanation.
* **Workspaces** is wrongly configured
  * Search for the workspace id which has the name of the source & target branch and reset that workspace. Once the workspace reset is complete, trigger a new merge.
* Failed to meet the actual code coverage criteria
  * Please update the merge criteria as needed by disabling code coverage under **Admin > My Account > Merge Settings**.

### Is it possible with ARM to limit merge approval to only one specific branch and not to others? <a href="#is-it-possible-with-arm-tool-to-have-merge-approval-only-for-one-specific-branch-and-not-for-others" id="is-it-possible-with-arm-tool-to-have-merge-approval-only-for-one-specific-branch-and-not-for-others"></a>

We don't have a feature to limit approvals to specific branches right now. However, there are a few options that can assist you in obtaining merge approval for a specific branch:

* When performing a merge, make sure none of the options under **New EZ Merge > Prevalidation Merge** are selected; this allows you to merge without approval.
* Under **Admin > MyAccount > Merge Settings**, make sure the '**disable merge self-approval'** checkbox is not selected.
