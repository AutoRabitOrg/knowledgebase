# Job Configuration

## Feature Overview

This is a reusable template that can be used to run, clone, and create a job every time a new job begins. This allows you to create a job in the replicate module and reuse the configuration as long as it is required, eliminating the need to recreate the job each time you need to work on the ‘Replicate’ module.

## Step-by-Step Guide

When creating the job configuration, select from: Backup, Hierarchical Backup, Archive, or Salesforce Live Data.

### Job Configuration – Backup, Hierarchical Backup & Archive

1. Access the “Job Config” under the “Replicate” module and create the “New Replicate Config” as shown below.

### Excluding Feed Items

Vault now automatically identifies and excludes system-generated FeedItems during the Replicate processes. This ensures these items do not cause any failures during the operation.

#### Key Features

1. **Automatic Identification**: System-generated FeedItems are detected and excluded without requiring manual intervention.
2. **Error Prevention**: By excluding these FeedItems, potential errors during Replicate processes are avoided.
3. **Logging for Transparency**: All excluded FeedItems are logged for tracking purposes, providing clear visibility into the process.

#### Logs

The following is a sample log for reference, showing the excluded system-generated Feeditems:

#### Replicate Log

Refer to these logs to verify the exclusions and ensure smooth operations during Replicate processes.
