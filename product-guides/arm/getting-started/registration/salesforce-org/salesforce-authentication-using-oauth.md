# Salesforce Authentication using OAuth

The **Salesforce** platform implements the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework**, so users can authorize applications to access **Force.com** resources. When configuring ARM and Salesforce source, you must know the **Client\_ID** and **Client\_Secret** token values for the Salesforce organization you want to index.

**Important Points to Consider**:

1. The following article is
   * **applicable for:** self-hosted and dedicated hosted users
   * **not applicable for:** shared cloud users
2. For share cloud customers, ARM has a pre-configured connected app via salesforce; therefore, _client\_id_ and _client\_secret_ fields are not exposed in the user interface. For more information, please refer to the link: [Adding a Salesforce Org connection via OAuth](../../../arm-administration/registration/salesforce-org/)

#### To get the Salesforce Client\_ID and Client\_Secret values <a href="#to-get-the-salesforce-clientid-and-clientsecret-values" id="to-get-the-salesforce-clientid-and-clientsecret-values"></a>

1. Log in to Salesforce as an administrator.&#x20;
2. In the drop-down list of the account (in the upper-right corner), select **`Setup`**.
3. In the navigation menu on the left, under **`App Setup`**, expand **`Create`**, then click **`Apps`**.
4. On the **`Connected Apps`** page, click the **`New`** button.
5. On the **`New Connected App`** page, fill in the following required fields under **`Basic Information`**:
   * Enter meaningful names in the Connected App Name and API Name boxes.
   * Enter your email in the Contact Email box to receive messages from this application.
6. Go to **`API (Enable OAuth Settings)`**, and select **`Enable OAuth Settings`**.
   * In the **`Callback URL`** field, enter _https://\<ARM access URL>/oauth/\_callback_ For example, _https://preview.autorabit.com/oauth/\_callback._
   * Depending on which OAuth flow you use, this is typically the URL that a userâ€™s browser is redirected to after successful authentication.
   * In the **Available OAuth Scopes** list, select the following items:
     * Access and manage your data (API)
     * Full access (full)
     * Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh\_token, offline\_access)
     * and click **Add** for each to appear in the **Selected OAuth Scopes** list.
7. Click the **`Save`** button to save the new **`Connected App`**.
8. In the **`Connected Apps`** list, find the **`App`** you just created and click **`Manage`**.
   * On the page that opens, click the **`Edit`** button.
   * Under **`OAuth policies`**, select **`All users may self-authorize`** in the **`Permitted Users`** list, then click the **`Save`** button.
9. Return to the **`Connected Apps`** list, and click the app you created.
10. In the page that appears for your new connected app, in the **`API (Enable OAuth Settings)`**section:
    * Copy the **`Consumer Key`** value and paste it into a secure reference document of your choice. The Consumer Key is the _client\_id_.
    * Next to **`Consumer secret`**, click **`Click to reveal`**, copy the value that appears, and paste it into your secure reference document. The Consumer secret is the _client\_secret_.
11. Open the _oauth.properties_ file in the _.rabit/org/oauth.properties_ directory and update the _client\_id_ and _client\_secret_ token during on-premise installation.

    ```actionscript
    clientId=<Consumer Key>
    clientSecret=<Consumer Secret>
    redirecturl=<AutoRABIT application access URL>/oauth/_callback
    hosturl==<AutoRABIT application access URL>
    ```
