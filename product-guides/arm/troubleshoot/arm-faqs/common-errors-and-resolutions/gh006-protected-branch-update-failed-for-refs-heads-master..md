# GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/master.

## Error message: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/master. Remote: error: Cannot force-push to a protected branch.

This error may be encountered while attempting to commit changes for a production organization to the GitHub master branch. This occurred because protected branches do not allow force-pushes. Get in touch with your Administrator to turn off the protection on that branch.
