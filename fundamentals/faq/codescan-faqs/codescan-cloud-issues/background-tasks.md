# Background Tasks

CodeScan is based on SonarQube™, an open source reporting platform for coding languages. The Background Tasks that occur when an analysis report is run have been added by SonarQube™ to allow administrators to view technical details about why the processes fail.

To learn more about background tasks, please see the [SonarQube Documentation - Background Tasks](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/background-tasks/).
