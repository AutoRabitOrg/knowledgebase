4. **Wait for an email from us.** Next, we review your details to check if they comply with our policies and to set up the rest of your account. When we've completed this process and your account is activated, you will get a confirmation sent to your email address.&#x20;

## Logging Out <a href="#logging-out" id="logging-out"></a>

When you are done working in ARM and wish to log out of the system, click your username in the upper right corner and click **`Logout`**. This will log you out completely from ARM, and you must log in again to access your account.

## How to Prevent Credential Sharing <a href="#automatic-logout" id="automatic-logout"></a>

ARM only allows a username to be logged in under one session, and any additional user sessions started using the same username will be logged out of the previous session. This mechanism is for security, as ARM does not allow multiple sessions for the same username from different machines or browsers. To prevent situations like this, please do not share your login credentials (username and password) with users in your organization.

Another situation where users are automatically logged out is when the user does not perform any actions in ARM for a certain period. Configuration settings in the ARM UI control the security timeout period in ARM.&#x20;

Users can have multiple tabs of ARM pages open within the same web browser (e.g., Chrome) without getting logged out of the system. For example, this is useful when working with multiple ARM pages or records without navigating away from previous pages.
