### About Data Archive <a href="#about-data-archive" id="about-data-archive"></a>

Data archives can be thought of as a data repository for infrequently accessed, but still readily available data. In [Vault](https://www.autorabit.com/products/vault-data-backup-recovery/), data archive is all about moving the unwanted data components from your Salesforce Org and freeing up the space for new data. This data is safely stored for future use. In a nutshell, Vault makes archiving [Salesforce data](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/how-to-backup-salesforce-data/) and backup simple, productive, and intuitive.

### Why is the Archival important? <a href="#why-is-the-archival-important" id="why-is-the-archival-important"></a>

1. Optimizing the data storage in Salesforce
2. For [Salesforce Org](../../configuring-vault/registering-salesforce-org/) with lots of data, searching for particular data is a pain
3. Application building in the Salesforce platform tends to run slower if unwanted data is available in your org.
