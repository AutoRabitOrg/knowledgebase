# How are Metric Definitions Defined?

[CodeScan](https://www.codescan.io/) is based on SonarQube™, an open-source reporting platform for coding languages. The metric definitions used for some of our rules including those based on complexity and duplication have been pre-defined by SonarQube™.

To learn more about the different metric definitions, please see the [SonarQube Documentation - Metric Definitions](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/metric-definitions/).
