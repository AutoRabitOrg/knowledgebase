### CodeScan Self-Hosted Editions: Latest Release Dates &#x20;

Our latest release of CodeScan is our Eagle Edition v6 (25.1.3), which was released in December 2025. Please refer to the release notes for [Eagle Edition v6](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/release-notes/release-notes/codescan-release-notes/on-premise-releases/eagle-edition/release-notes-25.1.2-eagle-5.0) for complete documentation of features.&#x20;

Our Eagle Editions are designed for those customers who run newer versions of SonarQube (Dec 2024–Dec 2025).&#x20;

It is important to note that in December 2024, SonarQube made the decision to separate their Community Build release from their other editions (Developer, Enterprise, and Data Center). As such, the version numbers of SonarQube Community Edition are different from the version numbers of these other editions (see below):&#x20;

Please note that once this split occurred, SonarQube released Community Build 24.12 in Dec 2024, and then released a new Community Build each month (25.1 – 25.12) for the calendar year of 2025.&#x20;

We have chosen to validate our CodeScan plugin for SonarQube on their Community Builds, as most of our customers use these editions of SonarQube. Our latest two Eagle Editions (v5 and v6) are validated on nearly each of these builds, up to and including Community Build 25.10. We are currently in the process of validating 25.11 and 25.12.  More detailed information can be found in our latest compatibility matrix for CodeScan Eagle v5 and v6. &#x20;

However, we also recognize that some of our customers are running either the Developer, Enterprise, or Data Center editions of SonarQube. As such, we have also listed these corresponding editions within this matrix. Please note that we do not currently validate CodeScan on these editions; however, we believe this information proves useful in determining which of these SonarQube editions should be compatible with CodeScan. Further, we are working closely with the SonarQube Alliances organization and intend to validate CodeScan on all SonarQube editions in the future.&#x20;

Currently, the most recent Long-Term Active version of SonarQube is 2025.4 LTA (released in July 2025), which is compatible with CodeScan Eagle Edition v6.&#x20;

Additionally, in order to support a wide range of these SonarQube versions, AutoRABIT provides two different versions of CodeScan self-hosted editions (Eagle and Tiger), thereby ensuring broad SonarQube compatibility. &#x20;

For customers running newer versions of SonarQube, we encourage you to upgrade to our CodeScan Self-Hosted Eagle Edition v5 (25.1.2) or v6 (25.1.3). These releases became generally available in October and December 2025, respectively. Together, they can run on nearly each of the last 13 Community Builds, up to and including Community Build 25.10.&#x20;

Separately, for customers running older versions of SonarQube (prior to Dec 2024), we encourage you to upgrade to our CodeScan Self-Hosted Tiger Edition. The latest version is Tiger Edition v3, which was released in February 2025.&#x20;

We do intend to keep as much feature parity with the editions as possible; however, there will be slight variances. Please review our release notes for detailed information regarding each edition’s respective capabilities. &#x20;

Please see our corresponding [Legacy SonarQube Compatibility Matrix ](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/product-guides/codescan/system-requirements-and-installation/installing-codescan-self-hosted#sonarqube-tm-download-1)for detailed guidance. &#x20;
