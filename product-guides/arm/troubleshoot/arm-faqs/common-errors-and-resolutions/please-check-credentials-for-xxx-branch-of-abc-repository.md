## Error message: Please check credentials for 'xxx' branch of 'abc' repository

Users may encounter this error when trying to connect to the Bitbucket repo, which typically relates to user permissions.  If you are using the wrong file format for the **package.xml,** then the above error occurs. Check the permissions you have on your Bitbucket repository with the repository owner/administrator. Request permissions other users have if you don't have the needed permissions.
