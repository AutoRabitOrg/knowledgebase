# CodeScan Overview

***

## Market Overview <a href="#market-overview" id="market-overview"></a>

Salesforce powers critical business processes and stores vast amounts of sensitive data.\
Because security controls, permissions, and customizations are encoded as **metadata**, a single coding error can introduce vulnerabilities or compliance gaps. Poor code quality slows feature velocity, increases technical debt, and widens the attack surface.

## What Is CodeScan? <a href="#what-is-codescan" id="what-is-codescan"></a>

**CodeScan** by _AutoRABIT_ is a **static code-analysis** solution built for Salesforce development.\
By scanning every commit—right from the developer’s IDE through the final CI/CD pipeline—CodeScan boosts quality, speed, and security.

## Why Was CodeScan Developed? <a href="#why-was-codescan-developed" id="why-was-codescan-developed"></a>

1. **Sensitive information everywhere**\
   Salesforce often stores customer PII, financial data, and proprietary business logic. Static analysis catches issues early, reducing exposure.
2. **Metadata amplifies risk**\
   Misconfigured profiles, permission sets, or flows can propagate vulnerabilities across orgs. CodeScan’s **metadata-aware rules** flag these dangers before deployment.
