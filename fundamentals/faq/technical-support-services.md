### 5. Support Response Time

AutoRABIT and Customer will work together to achieve consensus should there be any disagreement in assigned severities. Severities assigned to an Error may change with time if mutually agreed to by the parties. Response times for Errors will be measured from the time the Errors are logged by Customer into AutoRABIT’s support portal. Error activity will subsequently be managed and tracked through the support portal. Customer will have access to audit or review response and resolution time of Errors logged through the support portal.

AUTORABIT will use commercially, reasonable efforts to meet the timeline stated in the table above.

AUTORABIT will provide continuous efforts (24x7x365) to resolve Critical reported issues until a workaround or resolution can be provided or until the issue can be downgraded to a lower severity level.

5.3. When will the Support team close your Support Request?

Support Engineers will only close cases when the issue is resolved, and with Customer’s confirmation, unless:

* Support has tried repeatedly to contact Customer, and Customer has not responded.
* &#x20;A defined timeline for when the case can be closed if AutoRABIT has not heard from Customer (e.g. 3 business days).

6.1. Success Package II and III Customers with Premium Support – Issue Reporting

If Customer has elected Success Package II or III Support, issues reported using the Portal are routed to Customer’s Named Support engineer. This aids in resolution as the Named Support engineer is familiar with Customer’s environment(s), use cases, and project priorities based on interactions with dedicated contacts.

### 7. Support Error Investigation & Reporting Procedures

When an Error is discovered by Customer, Customer’s support personnel will first perform an initial\
reasonable investigation to evaluate whether the Error is caused by improper usage of the AutoRABIT SaaS Services or AutoRABIT Software, any dependency on Customer back-end systems, or a third-party application/software being used by Customer.  Once this process is completed and Customer’s support team has investigated the issue and reasonably determined it is not related to the foregoing, the Error will be reported to AutoRABIT.

Customer must describe the Error(s) with sufficient detail to enable AutoRABIT to identify and reproduce the Error.  Delays in supplying the requisite description may impact the Response/ Resolution time.

An initial report should include (but is not limited to) the following, based on the nature of the Error:

* A general description of the Error and its characteristics.
* The number of occurrences or frequency of the Error.
* The exact text of any Error messages reported by the AutoRABIT SaaS Services.
* Screenshots, if applicable.
* Time of occurrence of the issue(s) (with time zone).

On receipt of the Error and initial investigation details from Customer, AutoRABIT will begin diagnosing\
the Error and perform Support Services until:

1. The Error is resolved, or a workaround is provided.
2. Resolution is assigned back to Customer as a “Customer issue” if the Error is agreed by the\
   parties not to relate to AutoRABIT’s performance on the Network or the SaaS Infrastructure, or any other aspect of the AutoRABIT SaaS Services.
3. Resolution is assigned to a third-party (e.g. Salesforce for any API issues), if the Error is\
   agreed by the parties to be deemed to be the result of a third party’s services or products.

Customer agrees to reasonably cooperate with AutoRABIT during Error investigation and resolution, and AutoRABIT will ensure current status of any investigation and resolution is visible to Customer.  All Errors reported in the AutoRABIT support portal will be responded to in accordance with the severity\
level as described in Section 5 of this SLA.

**When Customer contacts AutoRABIT Support, the support engineer will:**

* Gather pertinent information related to Customer’s problem or service request.
* Assign a priority to Customer’s request (see Request Priorities below).
* Open a ticket in AutoRABIT’s issue tracking system and provide Customer with the ticket number\
  (if a ticket is not already raised).
* Begin to work the problem or fulfill the service request.
* Reassign the service ticket to another AutoRABIT engineer, as necessary.
* Keep Customer informed of the case progress or request status.

In the event Customer calls outside of normal office hours (8:00 AM to 5:30 PM local time) Customer must provide the following information:

* If existing case, provide case number.
* Description of the problem.
* Business Impact (Issue Priority).

### 8. Exceptions

Support Services do not include the following

SAAS SHARED INSTANCE:

* User behavior
* Third-party services or products

DEDICATED SAAS INSTANCE:

* User behavior
* Third-party services or products
* Any delay in communication due to hardware (low configuration or high usage)
* Network Connectivity

### 9. Network Availability

AutoRABIT is only responsible for the Availability of AutoRABIT SaaS Services. Self-Hosted Software customers are responsible for the availability of all services related to their Self-Hosted Software instance including availability, management and maintenance of AutoRABIT Software on Customer’s infrastructure. The AutoRABIT SaaS Services are hosted on Amazon AWS. AutoRABIT will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the Network is available with a 99.5% availability during any calendar month (“**System Availability**”). For calculation purposes, calendar months are deemed to begin at 12:00 a.m. U.S. Pacific Time on the first day of the calendar month and end at 11:59 p.m. U.S. Pacific Time on the last day of the calendar month.

System Availability is calculated as follows:

If AutoRABIT fails to meet the AutoRABIT System Availability levels below in any calendar month, Customer will receive a Service Level Credit equal to the corresponding percentage of monthly fees as set forth below. Customer agrees that the Service Level Credit will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for interruption of AutoRABIT SAAS Services and AutoRABIT’s failure to meet the System Availability in any calendar month.

\>>

| System Availability | Service Level Credit |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| 97.0% to 99.49%     | 5%                   |
| 95.0% to 96.99%     | 10%                  |
| 90.0% to 94.99%     | 20%                  |
| Below 90.0%         | 30%                  |

AutoRABIT will apply any Service Level Credits against future AutoRABIT SaaS Services fees. If Customer has multiple AutoRABIT SaaS Services accounts, then the System Availability for each account will be calculated separately for the purposes of determining eligibility for a Service Level Credit, and the Service Level Credit for each account will be calculated as a proportion of the fees applicable to that account. To receive a Service Level Credit, Customer must provide reasonably sufficient details for AutoRABIT to verify each unavailability incident that Customer is claiming

The System Availability percentage does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of the AutoRABIT SaaS Services or any other AutoRABIT SaaS Services performance issues: (i) caused by factors outside of AutoRABIT’s’ reasonable control, including any force majeure event or Internet access or related problems beyond AutoRABIT’s responsibilities set forth in the Agreement; (ii) that result from any actions or inactions of Customer including Customer not following the best practices described in the Documentation; (iii) that result from any Customer equipment, software or other technology and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within AutoRABIT’s direct control); or (iv) arising from AutoRABIT’s suspension or termination of Customer’s right to use the AutoRABIT SaaS Services in accordance with the Agreement (collectively, “Other SLA Exclusions”).
