# Check Time Stamp for Commit/Merge

**Description:**\
How can I view the precise date an EZ-Commit/Merge was triggered, instead of the system displaying a relative time frame like **"7 days ago"** or **"14 days ago"**?

**Resolution:**

1. Log into your ARM account.
2. Go to **Version Control > Commits**.
3. Select any **EZ-Commit/Merge** and hover the mouse over the icon where it says **XX days ago**.
4. The exact time stamp when the EZ-Commit or EZ-Merge was triggered is visible.
