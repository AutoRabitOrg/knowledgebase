# Feature Deployment Summary

### Feature Deployment <a href="#feature-deployment" id="feature-deployment"></a>

Feature Deployment is a deployment process that will allow you to easily deploy both metadata and data components using the feature migration template or using the dataset configured either from your Salesforce Org or Version Control.

### Feature Deployment History <a href="#feature-deployment-history" id="feature-deployment-history"></a>

The **Feature Deployment History** lists every deployment you have previously run using [AutoRABIT](https://www.autorabit.com/). It is also where you can view detailed deployment reports or re-deploy the nCino objects to your Salesforce Org/ Version Control.

### Accessing Feature Deployment History Page <a href="#accessing-feature-deployment-history-page" id="accessing-feature-deployment-history-page"></a>

You can visit **ncino > Deployment History** to view the Feature Deployment summary page or you'll be auto-redirected to this page whenever you trigger a deployment (using Feature Deployment).

By default, the jobs are listed in reverse chronological order; that is, the most recent job shows up first. Deployment history is shared amongst team members in AutoRABIT, so you may see deployments performed by other members of your team.&#x20;

**My Deployments** tab lists all of the deployment operations you have performed. The **Others** tab will list all other deployments made in AutoRABIT by your team.&#x20;

You can search for items in your history using the search box in the top right of the page.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (51) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="476"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can view all deployments (default), or only successful, failed, partially failed, in-progress or timeout deployments, or filter results by deployment label, feature name, the owner who carried out the deployment, or between to/fro dates.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (52) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="381"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To filter the deployment via **Feature Name**, you will have the versions list auto-populated to fetch the exact result.

You can either view compete log information in the user interface or save it to your local machine using ![](https://cdn.document360.io/8711f4e7-c040-4616-aac9-d947f87e4619/Images/Documentation/image-297.png)icon.

### Re-triggering the Deployment <a href="#retriggering-the-deployment" id="retriggering-the-deployment"></a>

Once you have fixed the deployment error or you like to re-trigger the deployment once again, you can click on the **Re-Deploy** button to quickly restart your deployment.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (63) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Choose the **'Destination Org'** and the deployment criteria you want to set for the deployment process.

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (64) (1).png" alt="" width="512"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the deployment is re-triggered, a new iteration gets auto-generated with new deployment log details. If the deployment gets failed due to any metadata or data objects, such a report can be found on this page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note**: AutoRABIT recommends fixing the errors generated and redeploying the process once again until the status changes to **Success**.
