# Version Control Branch Workflow

When working alone, you might clone a repository, make local changes, and push them back to the remote. However, in a team environment, multiple developers may need to make changes simultaneously to the same repository. To ensure that changes adhere to coding standards and maintain quality, implementing a [version control](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/7-tips-for-salesforce-version-control-integration/) workflow is essential. This approach facilitates code reviews and controlled integration of changes into the main codebase.

A widely adopted [version control](https://www.autorabit.com/blog/8-benefits-of-version-control-in-salesforce-development/) workflow, often referred to as the **Feature Branch Workflow** or **Topic Branch Workflow**, involves the following steps:

1. **Create a Branch**\
   Initiate a new branch for the specific changes you intend to make. A branch serves as an isolated environment where you can develop features or fix defects without affecting the main codebase or other developers' work.
2. **Commit Changes Locally**\
   As you work on your branch, commit your changes locally. This practice allows you to maintain a history of your modifications and facilitates easier tracking and potential rollbacks if necessary.
3. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**\
   Once you've committed your changes locally, push them to the remote repository. This action makes your branch and its changes accessible to other team members and tools that may perform automated processes like continuous integration.
4. **Create a Pull Request**\
   After pushing your branch, open a pull request (PR) to propose merging your changes into the main codebase. This step initiates the code review process, where team members can evaluate your changes.
5. **Review the Pull Request**\
   Team members review the PR to ensure that the changes meet the project's coding standards and do not introduce issues. This review process often follows a predefined checklist to maintain consistency and quality.
6. **Complete the Pull Request**\
   Once the PR has been reviewed and approved, it is merged into the main branch (commonly referred to as `main` or `master`). This step integrates your changes into the official codebase.
7. **Delete the Branch**\
   After successfully merging the PR, delete the feature branch. This practice helps keep the repository clean and prevents confusion with outdated branches.

Implementing this workflow promotes organized development, facilitates collaboration, and helps maintain a high-quality codebase.
