### Rules Not Available for On-Premises Applications

Please note that not all rules available on CodeScan Cloud are available in the Self-Hosted CodeScan version. For example, the following rules will not function on CodeScan Self-Hosted:

* Limit number of Custom Profiles with Modify All Data Permission (sfmeta:CustomProfilesPermission)
* Limit number of Page Layouts per object (sfmeta:ExcessivePageLayout)
* Limit number of Custom Fields per object (sfmeta:LimitCustomFields)
* Limit number of System Administrators(sfmeta:CheckSystemAdministrator)

These rules require a direct connection to the Salesforce environment to execute queries.

For a complete list of rules limited to CodeScan Cloud, see the file below:

**Note:** These rules do not apply to the plugin for on-prem as they will not function.
