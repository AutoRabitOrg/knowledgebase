# Email to Case Settings

Configure your **Email-to-Case settings** on this page. Each routing address is an email address that the customers can use to submit cases to your support team. Emails are automatically converted to cases based on the settings specified for each routing address.\
After you configure your Email-to-Case settings, choose whether to set up On-Demand Email-to-Case or Email-to-Case. On-Demand Email-to-Case enables you to solely use Force.com to convert email to cases, whereas Email-to-Case enables you to use salesforce.com and your email system to convert email to cases.\
**For On-Demand Email-to-Case:**

1. Define email addresses on your email system for case submissions.
2. Create email routing addresses that include the addresses defined for cases.
3. Configure your email system to forward case submissions to the Email Services Address provided to you by Salesforce.
4. Enable On-Demand Email-to-Case.

**For Email-to-Case:**

1. Download the Email-to-Case agent from the Apex Developer Network.
2. Install the agent behind your network firewall.
3. Configure email routing addresses.
4. Enable Email-to-Case.
