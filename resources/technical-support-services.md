## **Submitting Multiple Tickets**

Generally, we prefer separate issues to be reported via separate conversations. This allows different team members to work on these issues simultaneously to resolve them sooner. If you find you are working on a larger project with multiple issues, let us know ‚Äî we'll do our best to route these to the same Support Engineer to help address your concerns.

## **Seeking Additional Training**

We encourage each of our customers to access the [AutoRABIT LearningHub](https://learninghub.autorabit.com/s/) regularly as we continually refine and expand the training and help materials available there. If you need additional training on parts of the platform, you can arrange it through your Customer Success Manager. We are happy to help you identify how to utilize the platform better.
