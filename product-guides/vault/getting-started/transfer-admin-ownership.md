# Transfer Admin Ownership

If you are the current Administrator user of your Vault account and want to transfer your permission to another user, then you'll need to send an email to [support@autorabit.com](https://mailto:%3Asupport@autorabit.com/) with the following pieces of information:

1. Customer ID and the email address of the current Administrator
2. Email address of the new Administrator
3. Does the current Administrator wish to deactivate his user account?

**Note:**

1. The **new Administrator** should be an existing Vault user.
2. Only the **authorized member** of the **Customer Support Team** will have the privilege to transfer the admin ownership.
{% endhint %}

#### FAQ's <a href="#faqs" id="faqs"></a>

**Our admin user has left and we need to move permissions over**

If the admin (or _org admin_) user has left the company, we can change it here for you, but we require an email from another admin or an email from the company's CEO sent to [support@autorabit.com](https://mailto:%3Asupport@autorabit.com/). This is in order to verify this change request and to protect your data.
