Gain a clear understanding of who has access to critical permissions and how they were granted, streamlining compliance audits.&#x20;

* Enhance Security Posture&#x20;

By aligning Salesforce permissions with traditional security categories, your security team can better identify and mitigate potential risks.&#x20;

### How It Works&#x20;

1. Choose Your Org&#x20;
   1. Select the Salesforce org you want to analyze from the dropdown menu.&#x20;
2. Select Permissions&#x20;
   1. Pick one or more permissions to investigate.&#x20;
3. View Results&#x20;
   1. The tool displays a list of users matching the selected permissions.&#x20;
   2. Use the Diagram View or Tree View to explore how each user gained access, including all intermediate assignments.&#x20;
4. Take Action&#x20;
   1. Use the insights provided to adjust profiles, permission sets, or role assignments directly in Salesforce to reduce overprivileged access.&#x20;

&#x20;

**Permissions Explorer** is your one-stop solution for understanding, auditing, and managing Salesforce permissions, empowering your organization to maintain a secure and compliant environment.&#x20;

      1. Define the enforcement action (auto-revert or notify).&#x20;
      2. Specify email recipients for alerts.&#x20;
4. Detailed Violation Notifications&#x20;
   1. Receive detailed alerts when a violation occurs, including: &#x20;
      1. The permission set involved.&#x20;
      2. The user assigned the permission.&#x20;
      3. The action taken (e.g., permission reverted or admin notified).&#x20;
5. Scalable Governance Framework&#x20;
   1. Policies are the foundation of SPM’s governance features and will soon support additional capabilities, including password policies and governance rules.&#x20;
