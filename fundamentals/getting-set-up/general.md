#### What is an object? <a href="#what-is-an-object" id="what-is-an-object"></a>

An object is represented as a database table that stores organizational data. Objects consists of a set of fields, and we store data against that field.

#### What are the different types of objects in Salesforce? <a href="#different-types-of-object-in-salesforce" id="different-types-of-object-in-salesforce"></a>

There are two types of objects in Salesforce:

* **Standard Objects -** Standard Objects are those created by Salesforce, which you can use automatically. For example, accounts, contacts, chatter, leads, etc.
* **Custom Objects -** Salesforce Custom Objects are those created by a user. You can create any number of custom objects. For example, student info, college, etc.

#### What are Standard and Custom Fields? <a href="#what-are-the-standard-and-custom-fields" id="what-are-the-standard-and-custom-fields"></a>

* **Standard fields** for custom objects store information, such as created by, modified by, currency, name, owner, and division. These are the standard fields in Salesforce.
* **Custom fields** for custom objects store unique data or information for an organization.

#### What is Page Layout and Record Types? <a href="#what-is-page-layout-and-record-types" id="what-is-page-layout-and-record-types"></a>

* **Page Layout -** In page layout, customizations can be made, like fields, related lists, and custom links can be arranged.
* **Record Types -** Record types help to implement business processes like defining picklist values for standard and custom picklists.

#### What is the difference between Profiles and Permission Sets? <a href="#difference-between-profiles-and-permission-sets" id="difference-between-profiles-and-permission-sets"></a>

* **Permission Sets -** In Permission Sets, you can define the access level of the user. Generally, this determines what a user can do in the applications. These are used to grant additional permissions to a user.
* **Profiles -** Profiles are assigned to the user by the system administrator. A profile can be assigned to many users, but a user can only have one profile.

#### What is Field-Level Security? <a href="#briefly-describe-about-fieldlevel-security" id="briefly-describe-about-fieldlevel-security"></a>

We manage what a user can see, modify, and delete of a specific field in an object using field-level security. In other cases, such as when we want to give a user access control over an object, but we don't want them to be able to access certain fields in that object, we use field-level security.

#### What are Governor Limits in Salesforce? <a href="#what-are-governor-limits-in-salesforce" id="what-are-governor-limits-in-salesforce"></a>

Governor limits in Salesforce are the run time limits enforced by the apex runtime engine to write scalable and efficient code.

#### What is the difference between a Trigger and Workflow? <a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-trigger-and-workflow" id="what-is-the-difference-between-trigger-and-workflow"></a>

* **Workflow -** Workflow is an automated process, a point and click that doesn't need any coding. When you want to take action (email, task, field update, or outbound message) for the same object or from the child to a parent object, you can use Workflow rules. You cannot perform a DML operation on workflow. Workflows only work after some actions.
* **Trigger -** A trigger is a programmatic code approach that fires before or after a record is inserted, updated, or deleted. Using a trigger, you can work on multiple objects. You can query and perform any DML operation. The trigger works before and after some actions.

#### Is AutoRABIT compatible with the deployment of CPQ data? <a href="#is-autorabit-compatible-with-the-deployment-of-cpq-data" id="is-autorabit-compatible-with-the-deployment-of-cpq-data"></a>

As of now, we are currently supporting CPQ data deployment through our Data Loader Pro feature only. We'll be releasing a beta version exclusively for CPQ deployments in the coming months.
