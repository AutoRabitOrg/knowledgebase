# Unable to Delete Workspaces

## Error: Unable to Delete Workspaces

Despite having admin privileges in your instance, you are unable to delete certain workspaces, as the Delete button appears grayed out, as shown in the screenshot below.

The reason the Delete button is grayed out is that these workspaces are classified as Base Workspaces. Base workspaces are directly linked to a branch in your instance, and they cannot be deleted unless the associated branch is unregistered from AutoRABIT. When you register a new branch, a workspace is created, and they are tightly connected.

If you still wish to remove any workspace where the delete option is grayed out, please ensure that the related branch is no longer needed, and proceed to unregister the branch. Once the branch is unregistered, you will be able to delete the associated workspace.

See the [Workspaces](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/~/revisions/HjllPHzLVe0LqFYH7gIg/product-guides/arm/arm-administration/workspaces) page for more information.
