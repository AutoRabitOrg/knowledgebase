# Post Deployment Activities

### Introduction

Using this feature, users can perform the deployments to the Orgs selected on the post-deployment activities.

### Feature Overview

1. When creating the configuration, users can select multiple Orgs (max 5 allowed) for post-deployment activities.
2. This feature eliminates the necessity for performing multiple deployments to each individual Org if the same template(s) is required to be deployed to multiple Orgs.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Users can select multiple Orgs, as shown on the screenshot below, to deploy to while creating the config for CI Jobs.
