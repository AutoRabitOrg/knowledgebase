# Generate a Security Token

Security tokens allow you to authenticate integrations such as your IDE or CI tooling.

To generate the security tokens, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to your instance's URL, for example, [_https://app.codescan.io/_](https://app.codescan.io/) for **US** region, [_https://app-eu.codescan.io/_](https://app.codescan.io/) for **EU** region or [_https://app-aus.codescan.io/_](https://app.codescan.io/) for **AUS** region.
2.  Click on **`My Account`** at the top right of your screen to generate the tokens.\

3.  CodeScan supports two types of security tokens - **User** and **Project** tokens:\


    Generally, user's **User** token gives you full rights to the instance. A **Project** token gives you only right to run an analysis on the specific project it was generated for.

    Select the type according to your needs.
4.  Next, click on **`Security`** tab.\

6. The token you generate can only be viewed once after generation. Be sure to store it somewhere secure (such as a password manager) or add separate tokens for each integration to avoid problems in the future.
