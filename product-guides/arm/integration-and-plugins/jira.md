# JIRA

### JIRA: Overview <a href="#jira-overview" id="jira-overview"></a>

ARM-JIRA integration automatically posts updates to Jira tickets when you run validations and deployments, with a link back to the full report in ARM. It makes tracking the status of your user stories and support tickets faster and easier. Tasks can be organized by project, allowing an organization to track issues within projects transparently.

**To put it simply:** JIRA allows you to track any kind of unit of work (be it an issue, bug, story, project task, etc.) through a predefined workflow. However, in order to integrate JIRA as a plugin with ARM, it does require some steps in ARM to get it configured. The below section will help you out to get JIRA configured in ARM in easy steps.

Point to Note:**Jira OAuth** access type is currently supported for **Cloud versions** only. This function is on-demand, so if you'd want to make it available for your organization, please get in touch with our experts at [support@autorabit.com](mailto:support@autorabit.com).

### Integrate JIRA with ARM <a href="#integrate-jira-with-arm" id="integrate-jira-with-arm"></a>

#### Step 1: Store your user's JIRA credential in ARM <a href="#step-1-store-your-users-jira-credential-in-arm" id="step-1-store-your-users-jira-credential-in-arm"></a>

This is an initial step where the user's JIRA credential, such as username and password, is stored in ARM.

1. Log in to your ARM account.
2. Hover your mouse over the **Admin** module and click on the **Credentials** tab.

4. On the next pop-up screen, give a **Credential name**.
5. Choose the **Credential Type** as '**User name with Password.'**
6. Enter your JIRA **username** and **password;** we will store this encrypted.
7. Please double-check that you use your JIRA username instead of the email address that you use to log in to JIRA.
8. Click **Save**.

**Troubleshooting:**

While registering JIRA with ARM, JIRA fails to connect and results in **"Authentication Failure,"** please use the below steps to re-authenticate the JIRA.

1. Use the **"https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens"** link to generate a new API token.
2. Click on **"Create API Token,"** provide the label name and click on **Create**.
3. The token gets created. You will be able to see the **"Your new API token"** popup; click on the **"Copy to Clipboard."**
4. Use the copied token as a password for creating/updating the credential in ARM.
5. Once updated, please use the same credential to authenticate the JIRA.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 2: Integrate JIRA with ARM <a href="#step-2-integrate-jira-with-arm" id="step-2-integrate-jira-with-arm"></a>

1. If you're logged out from your account, log in again into ARM with your credentials.
2. Go to **Admin > My Account** section.
3. Click on **New ALM System** under the **ALM Management** section.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

5. Enter the **label name** of your own choice.
6. Enter your JIRA subdomain (e.g., _https://\[subdomain].atlassian.net_) in the **URL** field.
7. Select the same **user's credential** created in **Step 1**.
8. Click **Test Connection** to check if the connection has been authenticated or not. A success message is displayed after the authentication is completed.
9. Click **Save** and your Jira integration are ready.
10. Once you log in, JIRA is integrated with your ARM account, and you can start logging bugs and issues with just one click directly to JIRA.

### Mapping JIRA to Salesforce Org/ Version Control <a href="#mapping-jira-to-salesforce-org-version-control" id="mapping-jira-to-salesforce-org-version-control"></a>

2. Select the **Salesforce org** for which you like to map the JIRA as a plugin.
3. Under **Salesforce Org- Mappings** tab, choose **JIRA** as ALM type and click on **Mapping**.
