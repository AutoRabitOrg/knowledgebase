## How can I calculate the code coverage percentage for specific test classes?

1. Navigate to the **Admin** module.
2. Click on **SF Org Mgmt** (Salesforce Org Management).
3. Find and select the Salesforce org you wish to run the report on.
4. Click the **"Generate Code Coverage Report"** button.
5. A pop-up window will now appear with three options.
6. The correct option for your requirement is the last one: **"Run specified Test"**. Please select this.
7. You can then enter the specific test classes you want to run and review the results.
