# Release Notes 24.3

## Release Notes 24.3.2

**Anticipated release date: 22 September 2024**

The following release notes describe the enhancements featured in our next release. These items are being published in anticipation of a release date of 22 September 2024.

### Enhancements <a href="#enhancements" id="enhancements"></a>

**User Role Details in Export Report**\
The export report in the Admin section has been updated to include the assigned roles for each user. The "Role Name" column has been renamed to "Roles" to reflect the possibility of multiple roles assigned to a user. This allows administrators to download and analyze comprehensive user data, including their respective roles, directly from the My Admin â†’ Permissions tab.

**Enforced Limits on Release and Commit Label Revisions**

The system now enforces a limit of 100 revisions per release label and 100 revisions per commit label to optimize performance. Additionally, users are restricted to creating a maximum of two concurrent release labels. Error messages are displayed when these limits are reached. If the revision threshold needs to be increased, please contact Support and the ARM team can adjust release label limits at the tenant level.

**New Repository Cloning Strategy to Optimize Commit and Merge Process**

ARM now creates a single mirror clone for each repository as a base workspace and uses local clones for user workspaces. This reduces clone time, minimizes storage usage, and accelerates branch registration, deletion, and revision listing. Additionally, workspaces are deleted automatically after single use, further enhancing resource management. This change will greatly improve the performance and resource utilization of commit and merge processes, particularly for large repositories.

**Optimized Workspace Updates**\
The workspace update process has been optimized to reduce unnecessary updates. Instead of updating all workspaces daily, the system will now update only those that have been used in the last three days, based on information from the branch table. Additionally, before updating remote branches, the system will verify if the branch still exists at the source, skipping updates for deleted branches. Workspace size calculations will now use a command-based approach instead of iterating through each file, improving overall efficiency.

**Support for New Metadata Types**

ARM now supports the following metadata types:

* MessagingChannel
* ConversationMessageDefinition
* channelobjectlinkingrule
* datasourcetenantdatasrcdatamodelfieldmap
* InternalDataConnector
* MlDataDefinition
* MlPredictionDefinition

These updates ensure that users can successfully migrate Enhanced Bots and related components through ARM, including the EZ-Commit process.

**XML Code Coverage Report Conversion**

The system now supports the conversion of XML code coverage reports into a structured database format. This feature allows users to efficiently store, manage, and analyze coverage data for improved insights and reporting.

* **XML Data Conversion:** The system parses XML code coverage reports and converts all relevant elements and attributes into a structured database format for accurate code coverage reporting.
* **Database Schema:** A newly designed database schema stores key metrics such as coverage percentage, covered lines, total lines, and relevant metadata, enabling more efficient management and analysis of code coverage data.

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

**Improve Azure SSO Login Experience**\
An issue was reported with logging into ARM using Azure SSO, where login attempts failed after clearing the browser cache. In this release, the Spring SAML 2 provider was customized to remove certain instance-specific validations. Support Case: #115307

**Resolved Stored XSS Vulnerability in User Inputs**

The vulnerability involves Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) where user inputs like Credential Username, Search & Substitute, Template Name, and Token Name are not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts. To resolve this, ensure all user inputs are validated, sanitized, and HTML-escaped to prevent script execution, especially when handling data in HTML form for backend processes.

**Resolved Einstein Bot Deployment Erasing Unchanged Information**

The issue causing Einstein bot descriptions and connections to be erased during deployment has been resolved. Bots will now retain all unchanged information, including descriptions, after deployment. Support Case: #119658

**CI Job Package Processing Efficiency**

CI job processing has been improved to prevent full branch checkouts when "Trigger Build on Commit" and "Incremental Build" are enabled, ensuring only necessary changes are checked out, even with a baseline revision set. This enhancement speeds up CI job execution by reducing processing time and improving overall efficiency. Support Case: #116048

**SCA Refresh Functionality**

The SCA refresh process has been improved to correctly reflect changes made in CodeScan after updating issue statuses (e.g., "Resolved as false positive" or "Fixed") and marking the analysis as "Passes." Now, the SCA refresh accurately picks up changes from CodeScan, ensuring issue status updates are reflected in ARM as expected. Support Case: #118659

**Improved CI Job Deployment Accuracy**

The CI job has been improved to prevent unexpected metadata deletions. Previously, deleting a single JSON file caused the entire `leadImportUtility` member to be removed from the target Org. Now, the CI job ensures only the specific file deleted in the branch is removed, avoiding unintended changes during deployment. Support Case: #119321

**EZ-Merge Validation Accuracy**

The EZ-Merge process has been enhanced to prevent unrelated metadata changes from appearing during validation. Previously, even when the file diff did not show changes after a release label merge, the validation would incorrectly pick up record-type modifications. This update ensures that only relevant changes are reflected in the merge validation, improving accuracy and consistency in the EZ-Merge process. Support Case: #118669

**Resolved PMD SCA Report Download Issues**

Several improvements have been made to resolve issues with PMD SCA report downloads in the CI Job module:

1. The CSV file now correctly displays data when downloading the SCA report, addressing the issue of empty reports.
2. The download process has been updated to ensure only the PMD report is downloaded, instead of the entire zip folder.
3. The intermittent issue where the report did not download on the first attempt has been fixed, ensuring reports are successfully downloaded on the first try.

These updates enhance the reliability and accuracy of SCA report downloads. Support Case: #120621

**Repository Credentials Management**

The issue preventing users from changing repository credentials with only one registered repo has been fixed. Now, credentials can be updated even for a single repo. Additionally, sub-users can update credentials only for their own registered repositories, ensuring proper access control. Support Case: #120504

**Deployment Error Handling for Empty Folders**

A fix has been applied to prevent the "Index 0 out of bounds" error during Release Label deployments caused by empty folders in the repository. The system now ignores empty folders, ensuring smoother, uninterrupted deployments using version control. Support Case: #120987

**Admin User Privileges Stability**

An issue causing admin users to lose access to Orgs and Branches when modifying profiles has been resolved. Previously, changes to the "Skip Mappings" setting were unexpectedly reverting to false, leading to access issues. Now, profile modifications no longer affect the "Skip Mappings" setting, ensuring consistent user access to Orgs and Branches. This enhancement improves stability and reliability for admin privileges. Support Case: #121506

**CI Job 'Validate Only' Option**

An issue where the "Validate Only" option in CI jobs was not functioning correctly has been resolved. Previously, selecting this option during a manual build triggered a full deployment instead of a validation. Now, the "Validate Only" option works as expected, ensuring that the CI job only validates the build on the target org without deploying it. This fix enhances the accuracy of build validations. Support Case: #121541

**UI Display for "Include Custom Objects Child Profile Visibilities"**

An issue has been resolved where the "Include Custom Objects Child Profile Visibilities" button was incorrectly displayed in the UI when neither profile nor custom objects were selected. Now, the button only appears when both profile and custom objects are selected, ensuring the UI functions as intended during the EZ-commit process. Support Case: #121998

## Release Notes 24.3.1

**Anticipated release date: 9 September 2024**

### Enhancements

#### **Version Information Display for Vlocity Metadata**

Users can now view detailed version information, including the modification date, modified by, and creation date, for metadata when selecting Vlocity Metadata for deployment. This enhancement gives users visibility into the most recent changes and helps ensure they select the correct version for deployment.

#### **Exclude Metadata in Branching Baseline**

Users can now exclude specific metadata directly within the Branching Baseline interface, removing the need to adjust settings globally under My Account > Salesforce Settings. The interface includes Salesforce and Vlocity dropdown options based on the selected retrieval type. Users can easily search, select, or deselect metadata items using the new "Check All" and "Uncheck All" features for both included and excluded metadata sections.

This functionality is also available when using the re-run option, reflecting the same metadata exclusions from the initial run. If no metadata is selected, the system will automatically apply the global settings.

#### **Date-Range Report Download for ARM Weekly Report**

Users can now download reports within a selected date range. After clicking on "Refresh Reports View" to generate the latest reports, users can select a customizable date range using the "From" and "To" date pickers. The date range can be anywhere from 7 days to 6 months. Once the date range is set, users can click "Download" to obtain the reports within the specified period. If the report generation is still in progress, the date selection and download options will be temporarily disabled until the reports are ready.

#### **Improved Profile Metadata Handling and Permissions Management on EZ-Commit**

Users can now more effectively manage profile metadata and permissions during commits with the introduction of new options and improved handling in the Review Artifact process.

**Key Features:**

1. **Child Fields and Permissions Checkbox:**
   * A new checkbox labeled "Custom Objects include all child fields and child field permissions" has been added. This is automatically selected by default, allowing users to include or exclude child field permissions when committing custom object profiles. If users prefer not to include any child field permissions, they can simply unselect this option.
   * This checkbox is visible only when custom objects and profiles are selected.
2. **Renamed Option for Clarity:**
   * The checkbox "Commit Options for Selected Profiles" has been renamed to "Commit Profile Metadata Only \[Includes Permissions for Selected Objects]" to more accurately reflect its function.

**Scenarios:**

* **Including All Permissions:**
  * When the user edits field permissions and selects the checkbox "Custom Objects include all child fields and child field permissions," all child permissions will be included in the commit.
* **Excluding Child Permissions:**
  * If the user edits object or field permissions and unchecks the checkbox, only object permissions will be committed, excluding all child permissions.
* **Commit Profiles Only:**
  * Selecting "Commit Profile Metadata Only" while unchecking the child permissions checkbox will result in committing only object permissions, excluding changes in child permissions and review artifact updates.
* **Full Profile Commit:**
  * When "Commit Full Profiles" is selected, the child permissions checkbox will be auto-checked and disabled, ensuring all permissions are included while excluding any review artifact changes.

This enhancement provides greater control over what is included in profile commits, ensuring more precise and targeted updates.

### Improvements

**UI Filter for InstalledEditable State in Deployments**

A new UI filter has been added for the "InstalledEditable" state in deployments. When the "Exclude Managed Packaged Components" option is selected in Admin (Salesforce Settings), the deployment filter will automatically have the "Installed" and "InstalledEditable" states unchecked by default. If the option is not selected, these states will be checked by default. This enhancement simplifies deployment filtering based on the chosen settings. Support case #118691

**Unified Icons Across UI**

The icons on the UI screen have been updated across all modules for better visibility. The updated icons are now consistent across the following modules: CI Jobs - Deploy Only, Modularization, Custom Deployment, Scratch Org, and Org Sync. This change does not introduce any new logic but ensures a more cohesive visual experience across the platform.

**Hiding the Auto Approve Option According to Merge Settings Response**

The 'Auto Approve on Merge Validation Success' option will now only be displayed during a merge if it has been enabled under the merge settings. If this option is not enabled by the user in the merge settings, it will no longer appear when performing a merge. Support case #119940

**Retention of SF Org Mappings During Sub-User Permission Updates**

Previously, when an Admin updated permissions for a sub-userâ€”such as granting additional SF Org or branch access or revoking consentâ€”the SF Org mappings for that sub-user were being removed. Now, SF Org usernames are retained when saving these updates. This ensures that sub-user profiles maintain their correct mappings after permission changes. Support case #120346

**Resolved Special Characters Issue with Re-Uploading Files After Merge Conflict**

A fix has been implemented to address an issue where users experienced a problem after resolving and re-uploading a conflicted file during a merge. Although the upload was successful, the verification process would not complete. This was caused by special characters in the label name or file name. The front end now uses an encoded URL for label names and file names containing special characters, ensuring the verification process completes successfully. Support case #120393

**Improved CI Job Build Stability**

An issue was identified where CI job builds were failing due to the use of identical variable names in both parent and child classes. This caused problems during JSON conversion in certain edge cases, leading to build failures. The underlying code has been updated to handle these scenarios more robustly, preventing conflicts and ensuring CI job builds proceed without errors. Support case #120527

**Improved Error Handling During Merge Conflicts**

An undefined error occurred when customers attempted to upload a merge-conflicted file. This issue has been addressed by making changes to the API payload and implementing minor UI adjustments. The impacted areas include the SCM Conflict Report and the SCM Merge Conflict and Review Artifact screen. Support case #120867

**Improved Ticket Detection in ALM CI Jobs**

A problem was identified where ALM CI Jobs stopped detecting tickets. This issue has been resolved by adding conditions to the database query to account for all types of completion values. Support case #120882

**Commit Template Component Limit Increased**

The commit template was limited to displaying 50 components, even when more components were selected. This limitation has been addressed by adding a data-table check for all metadata component members. The commit template can now handle and display 200 components. Support case #120095

**Report and Folder Deployment Stability**

An issue was identified during the package preparation process using Package.xml, metadata.zip, or Org-to-Org deployment for the Reports metadata type, leading to deployment failures. To address this, the logic has been corrected to ensure that -meta.xml is properly removed from components being added to Package.xml for reports and dashboards. This fix improves the reliability of report and folder deployments. Support case #121356

**Default Exclusion List**

Removed the messaging channel from the default exclusion list. Support case #119852
