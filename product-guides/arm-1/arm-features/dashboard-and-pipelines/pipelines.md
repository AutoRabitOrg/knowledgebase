# Pipelines

### Pipeline: Overview <a href="#pipeline-overview" id="pipeline-overview"></a>

A pipeline is a unidirectional flow that defines how changes progress from development orgs to the production org. It offers real-time visibility into:

1. Branches across DevOps stages: **Development, Integration, QA, UAT, Production**
2. Sync status between mapped Salesforce Orgs and branches (e.g., added/removed components)
3. Commits that are ahead or behind each stage

**Steps to access the Pipeline view:**

1. Hover over the **DASHBOARD** tile and click **PIPELINE**.
2. Select a **Repository** to view your teamâ€™s branching structure.

### Known Limitations <a href="#known-limitations" id="known-limitations"></a>
