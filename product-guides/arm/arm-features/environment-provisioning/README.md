# Environment Provisioning

### Introduction to Environment Provisioning <a href="#introduction-to-environment-provisioning" id="introduction-to-environment-provisioning"></a>

Environment Provisioning is a unique interface provided by AutoRABIT to quickly facilitate a Salesforce sandbox with metadata and/or data requirements that suit specific needs. These can be created as a template and stored in AutoRABIT. The same templates can be reused multiple times across various modules in AutoRABIT.

**For example-** You can create an Environment Provisioning template to disable validation rules, enable history tracking, anonymous Apex, etc., of a certain object as a post-deployment setup.
