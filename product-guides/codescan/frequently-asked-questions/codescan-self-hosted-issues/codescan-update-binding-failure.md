# CodeScan Update Binding Failure

If the CodeScan update binding is getting failed, try disabling the VPN and antivirus, then try updating the binding again.

**If the binding successfully updates,** the error occurred due to antivirus blocking CodeScan. Add CodeScan to the list of allowed sites for the antivirus in use.

**If the binding still fails**, raise a [Support Ticket](https://support.autorabit.com/portal/en/home), including the **analyzer logs** and **verbose logs** in the attachment.
