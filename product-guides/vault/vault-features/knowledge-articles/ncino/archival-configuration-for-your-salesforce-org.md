# Archival Configuration for your Salesforce Org

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Data archives can be thought of as a data repository for infrequently accessed, but still readily available data. In Vault, data archival is all about moving the unwanted data components from your Salesforce Org and freeing the space for new data. This data is safely stored for future use. In a nutshell, [Vault](https://www.autorabit.com/products/vault-enterprise-backup-and-recovery/) makes Salesforce data archiving and backup simple, productive, and a joy to use.&#x20;

### Procedure <a href="#procedure" id="procedure"></a>

1. Login to your Vault account.
2. Go to **Setup** and search for the [Salesforce Org](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/docs/salesforce-org-managements) from which the data has to be archived. You can use the **Search** filter to easily filter out the required Salesforce Org.

3. Select the desired Salesforce Org.
4. The next step is to create Archival Config, navigate to the **Configs** tab, and click on **Add Archival Config**. This will allow you to view all the components available in your Salesforce Org and choose the components for which you want to define the archival policy.

5. Select the components that you need to archive on the next screen.

6. Using **Filter** you can define the criteria on which the records will get fetched.\
   **For ex-** If you can define criteria to fetch Case records that are older than 1000 days and are in the closed state Validate your query to see whether the criteria set is correct and view the number of records that will be fetched. You can even set the record count limit for your data being fetched. Click on **Apply** to set the criteria and close the Filter dialog box. For easy identification of objects on which filter is applied, the filter icon is highlighted.

7. The **Hierarchy** option will allow you to view all the corresponding child objects for your selected object. These child objects will also get archived once you archive their parent object. Such a hierarchy schema view can be seen using the **Hierarchy** option.
   * You may notice in the schema view that some of the objects are auto-selected by default and cannot be unchecked. These are the child objects of its parent object which will be deleted for sure if its parent object is selected for archival policy. However, for other objects which are related to the selected object in some other way, you may have the option to choose them manually for archival.

9.  Click **Next.** On the next screen, do the following:

    * Give the process a **name**.
    * Select the **email notification** checkbox to receive an email notification whenever the objects are getting deleted from your Salesforce Org. If unchecked, data will be automatically deleted without any prior notification.
    * Select the date and time interval for the archival process to run under the **Schedule Archival** section. You can set the policy to run either daily, weekly, monthly, or input any duration manually.
    * You can specify to what time period you want to retain the archived data under the **Archival Retention period** section.
    * Specify the **batch size** for components to retrieve records. 10K is the max batch size that you can set per batch. This option is useful in running large jobs that would exceed normal processing limits. As per the Salesforce governor limit, you can deploy or retrieve up to 10,000 files at once or a max size of 40MB. Using Batch Size, you can process records in batches to stay within platform limits. If you have a lot of records, processing records through batches are your best solution.
    * **Enable serial mode for Bulk API:** Serial mode processes batch one at a time, however, it can increase the processing time for a load.&#x20;
