# Release Notes 4.2

### CodeScan 4.2 <a href="#codescan-42" id="codescan-42"></a>

#### New Features <a href="#new-features" id="new-features"></a>

**New Apex Rules**

* **Avoid Insecure Digest Algorithms**: MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms are no longer considered secure because it's too easy to create a hash collision between two message contents.
* **Avoid Salesforce System Class Names**: Classes with names that already exist as internal classes will take precedence due to namespacing.
* **Avoid Nested Switch Statements**: Avoid creating nested 'switch' statements since they are error-prone, harder to read, and harder to maintain.
* **Avoid Reversed Operators**: Reversing operators may be a bug, or at the very least make it hard to read.
* **Avoid Using HTTP Referer Headers**: HTTP Referer headers can be modified by attackers. Making a decision based on the value of the referer can be dangerous.
* **Catch Block Should Do More Than Rethrow**: Catch blocks that do nothing but rethrow an exception should either be changed or removed.
* **Field Level Security Vulnerabilities**: This rule makes sure that the code checks for access permissions before running a SOQL, SOSL, or DML operation.\
  **Single Method Singleton**: Avoid using overloaded getInstance methods.\
  Statements Should Be On Separate Lines\
  Statements should be on separate lines to increase readability and maintainability.
* **Suspicious For Loop Incrementer**: Incrementers that do not match the body of the for loop could be a bug.
* **Ternary operators that can be simplified with || or &&**: Ternary operators with the form `condition ? literalBoolean : foo` or `condition ? foo : literalBoolean` can be simplified.
* **Unexpected Casting of Types**: When arithmetic is performed on a type, the type remains the same even if the result is a different type. This can return an unexpected result.

**Updated Apex Rules**

* **Division By Zero**: Division by zero exception may occur when zero could be the denominator to a division or modulo operation.
* **Apex Classes should use Random IV/Key**: Now checks for EncodingUtil.base64Decode(key);

**New Visualforce Rules**

* **Avoid using GETSESSIONID() and $API.Session\_Id**: Lightning Experience does not have access to the API session token. Visualforce pages that access the session ID should be tested within Lightning Experience.
* **External Script and Style Resources Should Be Avoided**: Including content from untrusted sources can lead to various security issues including include injection of malware.
* **Remove OnClick Javascript**: Javascript in "onclick", "onmouseover" and similar actions within components are ignored.
* **Require CSRF Protection On GET Requests**: Require CSRF protection on GET requests must be enabled from the Visual Force Page settings.
* **Unencoded Formulas In Style Tags XSS**: Makes sure that all values obtained from URL parameters are properly escaped / sanitized to avoid XSS attacks.
* **Unescaped Value Could Cause XSS**: Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occurs when an attacker injects browser executable code within a single HTTP response. Using unescaped parameters can be a security risk.
* **Avoid Apex Tags Within Script**: Avoid using \<apex:\*> tags within \<script> tags for readability and security.
