# Error Code 413

### Description

I get a **413-status error** in the browser console when I try to upload duplicate profile files that have been resolved after downloading from version control.

### Cause

When you try to download numerous files at one go, you'll see such an issue.

### Resolution

If you download one profile file at a time, you should be able to do it without a problem.
