# How does TAF Accelerate Test Automation and Reduce Costs?

AutoRABIT TAF is based on a record and playback solution that can rapidly generate automated test scripts without the need for complex programming/scripting expertise. QA team members/Business Analysts can record the test scripts from a browser plug-in and upload to AutoRABIT, thus giving the power to the teams to rapidly automate the scripts and build a regression suite.&#x20;

Once automated, a regression test suite can reduce significant cost, effort, and time of testing in future releases. It also adds scalability to the teams to develop multiple applications in parallel and increase the release velocity.
