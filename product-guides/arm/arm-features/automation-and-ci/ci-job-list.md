For Vlocity (FlexCard/OmniScript) deployments:

The destination org must be registered with OAuth. If it's registered with Standard, re-register with OAuth or deployment will fail. The following log message appears:

To deploy compiled versions of OmniScript and FlexCards, Please re-register your destination org with OAuth and update the Local Compilation key in the My Account section

Enable Local Compilation and enter a valid Access Key under My Account:

Missing key:

Deployment will be performed without local compilation due to the absence of Access Key of Vlocity's Private NPM Repository

Invalid key:

Deployment is completed without local compilation due to the incorrect Access Key of Vlocity's Private NPM Repository

Activate/Deactivate: Temporarily disable jobs without deleting them. Reactivate when needed. This prevents unintended builds without loss of job data.

Delete: Permanently remove the job. This action is irreversible.
