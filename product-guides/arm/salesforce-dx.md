# Salesforce DX

**Salesforce Developer Experience (DX)** is an essential module of ARM that streamlines the entire development life cycle. It improves team development and collaboration, facilitates automated testing and continuous integration, and makes the release cycle more efficient and agile. Itâ€™s a new approach that supports team collaboration, focusing on predictability, quality, and a standardized development life cycle on Salesforce.
