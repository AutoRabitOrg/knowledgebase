# Accepting invitations to add a user to a CodeScan Organization

#### Accepting an invitation (Auth0 only)

1. Wait for your Admin to invite you to the CodeScan Cloud organization.
2. If you can't find the invitation link in your Inbox, check Spam and Junk folders.
3. Once you have the invitation link, click on it (please note it's valid only for a certain period of time and can only be used once):

4. You will be redirected to the Login screen. As it's your first time to CodeScan, select the **Sign Up** option:

5. On the sign-up screen you will enter your details and create a password, which you will use to log into your CodeScan account:

6. Depending on your team's requirements, you can also enable MFA (can be done later)
