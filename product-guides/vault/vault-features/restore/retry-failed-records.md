# Retry Failed Records

## Overview

The retry failed records feature provides a streamlined way to reprocess only the failed records from Restore jobs. Instead of rerunning the entire job, Vault allows retrying failed records exclusively, saving time and improving efficiency.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1.  After a job completes, the retry option becomes available to reprocess failed records.

3. In Retry Restore Summary, selecting 'Restore Now' will only attempt to restore failed records.
4. The retry option remains available for seven days from the time the job is initiated.
5.  After the retention period elapses, the retry button is disabled (grayed out).
