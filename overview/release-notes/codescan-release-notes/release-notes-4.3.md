#### New Features <a href="#new-features" id="new-features"></a>

**New Apex Security Hotspots**

* **Deserializing JSON Is Security-Sensitive**: Deserializing an object from an untrusted source is security-sensitive. An attacker could modify the content of the data.
* **Encrypting Data Is Security-Sensitive**: Encrypting data is security-sensitive. Although most encryption problems are solved or managed by Salesforce, care must be taken when relying on encryption.
* **Type Reflection Is Security Sensitive**: Dynamically executing code is security-sensitive. If the code comes from an untrusted source, the untrusted source may be able to choose which code to run.
* **Using Cookies Is Security-Sensitive**: Attackers can use widely available tools to view the cookie and read the sensitive information. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.
* **Using UserInfo.GetSessionId() Is Security-Sensitive**: The use of UserInfo.GetSessionId() is security-sensitive. Ensure that you need to do this.

**New Visualforce Security Hotspots**

* **Using GETSESSIONID() and $API.Session\_Id is security-sensitive**: The use of GETSESSIONID() and $API.Session\_Id is security-sensitive. Ensure that you need to do this.
