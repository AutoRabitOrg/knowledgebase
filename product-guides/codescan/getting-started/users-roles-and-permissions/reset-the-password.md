# Reset the Password

In general, you’ll only need to reset your password if you’ve forgotten it, but there are some instances when resetting your password can help protect the security of your account.

We recommend resetting your password in these cases:

* You notice something suspicious in your CodeScan account.
* You suspect someone you don't trust may have your password.
* We ask you to change your password.

If you have not requested to reset your password and you receive an email asking you to change it, it could be a case of phishing. Instead of clicking on a suspect link in an email, log into your account to reset your password there.
