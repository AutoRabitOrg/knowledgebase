# Accepting invitations to add a user to a CodeScan Organization

#### Accepting an invitation (Auth0 only)

1. Wait for your Admin to invite you to the CodeScan Cloud organization.
2. If you can't find the invitation link in your Inbox, check Spam and Junk folders.
3. Once you have the invitation link, click on it (please note it's valid only for a certain period of time and can only be used once):
