## Guard 25.2.4 Release Notes

**Release Date: 10 September 2025**

### API Security

We’re launching API Security in Guard to help customers identify and mitigate risks from third-party apps connected to Salesforce. As attacks on Salesforce orgs increase, including from unverified or over-permissive apps, this feature gives teams visibility into which apps are connected, how they’re being used, and whether they pose a risk.

AutoRABIT Guard introduces a new API Security tab under the Risk section. From here, users can inspect API activity for a specific Salesforce org in real time.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2010).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Value to Users:**

* Increased security visibility: Spot risky or shadow apps that might otherwise go unnoticed.
* Proactive defense: Prevent over-permissive apps from giving unauthorized users access to critical data.
* Multi-org management: Quickly assess and compare API risks across all Salesforce orgs.

### Permission Explorer Enhancements

**User Details at a Glance**\
&#x20;Admins can now view detailed user information directly within Permissions Explorer, including:

* Full name, active/inactive status, and last login.
* Creator details and their current status.

This makes it faster to investigate suspicious permissions and strengthens overall security posture.

**Object-Level Access Insights**\
&#x20;A New Object Access Mode makes it easy to see who can perform actions (Read, Create, Edit, Delete) on both standard and custom Salesforce objects. With filtering by Profile, Role, or Email, compliance audits and security reviews are now faster and more accurate.

**New Filters in Permissions Explorer**\
&#x20;Permissions Explorer now offers additional Super Admin permission filters, including:

* Setup & Configuration access.
* AppExchange package downloads.
* Approval of uninstalled connected apps.

These updates give admins greater visibility into high-risk privileges.

### Risk Assessment Improvements

* Business-Oriented Risk Labels: Risks are now described in simple, more understandable terms. Once resolved, risks display positive compliance outcomes to reinforce progress.
* Navigation Enhancements: Users can browse between risks with new “Previous” and “Next” buttons, cycling through seamlessly.
* Dedicated Risk Detail Page: Clicking on a specific risk now opens a full detail page, providing richer context and better usability.
* Certificate Settings Clarity: Updated UI labels make certificate key sizes and expiration values easier to understand and configure correctly.

These changes make Risk Assessment more accessible for both technical and non-technical stakeholders, while streamlining the review process.

### Usability & UI Enhancements

* Information Hierarchy: Organizations are now grouped into clear priority categories (Critical, Quick Wins, Compliant), making it easier to focus remediation efforts.
* Improved Icon Visibility: Table header icons are now larger and easier to read, improving accessibility and UI consistency.
* Data Classification Transparency: A new “Non-Started” state prevents confusion and allows users to trigger analysis manually when needed.

### Bug Fixes

* Data Classification Export: Email notifications correctly include attached exports.
* Permissions Explorer: Accurate Access visibility ensured.
* User Management: Enforced validation for mandatory fields and added clear toast messages for success/error feedback.

### Backend & Infrastructure

* Database Cleanup: Removed legacy tables for improved performance and maintainability.
* Tenant Deletion API: A new API introduced to enable safe and auditable tenant removal.

## Guard 25.2.3 Release Notes

**Release Date: 20 August 2025**

### New User Creation Simplified

Creating new users is now faster and more flexible. Admins can set up accounts with just an **email address** and **role**. Other details (username, first name, and last name) are optional and hidden by default but can be filled out as needed.

* The system now **automatically handles username conflicts** by suggesting available alternatives.
*   The **user list view** and **user icons** have been updated to reflect these enhancements.\

### Improved Account Protection

To enhance security and prevent accidental or malicious account removals:

* **Admins** can no longer delete or deactivate their own accounts but still can manage Standard User accounts.
* **Standard Users** cannot delete or deactivate their own or any other accounts.

This change helps maintain system stability and protects privileged accounts.

### Stronger Role Management Controls

We’ve introduced new safeguards to reduce the risk of privilege loss or escalation:

* Admins can no longer **downgrade themselves** to Standard User.
* Admins can still **promote Standard Users** to Admin.
* Standard Users cannot change anyone’s role.
* All role changes are now logged for better auditing and compliance.

### Single Sign-On (SSO) with Enhanced Security

Guard now supports **Single Sign-On (SSO)** using **encrypted SAML assertions**.\
&#x20;This ensures:

* Sensitive authentication data is securely transmitted.
* Reduced risk of data interception or tampering.
* Compliance with **federal security standards**.

### Bug Fixes

* **User Unlocking**: Resolved an issue with locked accounts that couldn’t be unlocked from the Settings page. Admins can now restore users' access without any errors.

### Other Enhancements

* **Security & Compliance**: We have strengthened our platform’s security by implementing targeted improvements that meet stringent federal standards. These updates reduce potential attack surfaces and further enhance data protection.
* Implemented a few back-end optimizations to enhance system stability and ensure long-term maintainability, supporting a smoother and more reliable user experience.

## Guard 25.2.2 Release Notes

**Release Date: 23 July 2025**

1. Risk Assessment is goal-oriented now!

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1816).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We have grouped risks under four key Security Goals:

**Goal 1: Establish Secure Access & Identity**

Ensuring only authorized users access Salesforce, their identities are verified, and highly privileged access is governed.

**Goal 2: Harden Application & Session Security**

Protecting the Salesforce application from common web vulnerabilities, ensuring secure communication, and maintaining user session integrity.

**Goal 3: Safeguard Data & Control Exposure**

Protecting data confidentiality and integrity by managing sharing settings, controlling access to sensitive information, and limiting guest user access.

**Goal 4: Ensure Foundational Platform Integrity**

Maintaining the core security of the Salesforce platform via valid configurations for certificates, encryption, and secure external connections.

Users can see their progress towards achieving each Goal and remediate the associated risks accordingly.&#x20;

2. Custom Permission Explorer queries can be saved

Just give your query a name and definitive description, and it will be saved for your future revisits:
