# Adding Projects to CodeScan

This document provides a description about how to create a project in CodeScan.

### Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisities" id="prerequisities"></a>

You will need a CodeScan organization to add a project to it. When signing up with [CodeScan Cloud](https://www.codescan.io/products/cloud/), an organization is created automatically under your user name. New organizations can be created at any time using the '**+**' icon at the top right corner of the screen.
