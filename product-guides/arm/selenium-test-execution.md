3. On the next screen, enter the job name and description if any.&#x20;
4. Select the Test Cases under the **Test labels** section.
5. Select the **Salesforce Org** where you would like to run the above test cases.
6. Select the Browsers to carry out the functional test.
7. Schedule the test execution process by filling in the required details like day, time, and the interval for the process to run.
8. Next, click on either the **Save** or **Save & Start** button. The later button will run the current process once the test cycle is saved.
