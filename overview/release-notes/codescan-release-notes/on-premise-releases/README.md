# On-Premises Releases

## Current Releases&#x20;

**Release Dates: August/September 2024**

{% hint style="info" %}
**SonarQube Compatibility**: We recognize that self-hosted customers have different requirements for SonarQube (SQ) versions. As such, CodeScan is committed to supporting a wide spectrum of versions to accommodate this variance.
{% endhint %}

**CodeScan On-Premises Versions:** As SonarQube continues to release new versions consistently every 2–3 months, we decided to offer **two versions of CodeScan self-hosted** to ensure ongoing compatibility. We intend to keep as much feature parity with the editions as possible; however, there will be slight variances. Review the following diagram for more information.&#x20;
