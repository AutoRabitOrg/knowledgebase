# Understanding Duplicate File Change Commits in Git

## Overview

Git’s handling of duplicate file change commits introduces a unique aspect of version control management, particularly when merging branches with identical changes.

This article explores a scenario in which identical file changes are merged twice, examining how Git manages commit history and why duplicate commits may occur under specific conditions.

## Scenario Description

In a recent test, we followed these steps to observe Git’s behavior:

### 1. First Merge

* Initiated a merge operation with specific file changes.
* Approved the merge.
* Git created a new commit to record the merge, even though the changes were already present.

### 2. Second Merge

* Performed another merge with the **same file changes**, involving the **same source and destination branches** and **same head revision**.
* Approved and committed the changes using the merge label.

### 3. Repository Update

* The changes were pushed into the repository after clicking the **Commit** button.
* However, the content was already reflected from the first merge.

## Understanding Git’s Behavior

Git permits the creation of duplicate commits under certain conditions:

1. **Commit Creation**\
   Each merge, even with identical content, results in a **distinct commit**. Git records this as part of its linear commit history.
2. **Head Revision Consideration**\
   If the merge operation uses an **older revision**, Git evaluates it based on timestamps. A new commit is created if the merged revision precedes the current HEAD.

## Implications and Use Cases

1. **Version Control Integrity**\
   Git ensures data integrity through commit hashes and timestamps, even when recording identical file changes across multiple commits.
2. **Tool-Agnostic Behavior**\
   This behavior is consistent across environments—whether merges occur via command-line Git or integrated CI tools like AutoRABIT. Git remains robust and predictable.

## Conclusion

Git’s flexibility in managing duplicate file change commits—especially under chronological discrepancies—reinforces its reliability as a version control system. Understanding these nuances allows teams to maintain accurate commit histories and effectively manage code across branches.
