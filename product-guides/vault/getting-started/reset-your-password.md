# Resetting your Password

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

In general, you’ll only need to reset your password if you’ve forgotten it, but there are some cases where resetting your password can help protect the security of your account. We recommend resetting your password in these cases:

1. You notice something suspicious in your [**Vault™**](https://www.autorabit.com/products/vault-data-backup-recovery/) **account.**
2. You suspect that someone you don't trust may have your password.
3. We ask you to change your password.

If you have not requested to reset your password and receive an email asking you to change it, it could be a case of phishing. Instead of clicking on a suspect link in an email, log into your account to reset your password.

### Procedure <a href="#procedure" id="procedure"></a>

1. Anyone can reset their password by clicking the **Forgot Password?** link on the sign-in page.
