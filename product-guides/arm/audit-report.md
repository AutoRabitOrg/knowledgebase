### **Job Audit Report** <a href="#job-audit-report" id="job-audit-report"></a>

A new call-to-action button is added in ARM in the **CI Job Results** screen called **Job Audit Report.** This feature lets you download and see the status of deployment build operations and commits associated with a deployment in the **Audit Report (PDF)** file. This will also be helpful during internal auditing.
