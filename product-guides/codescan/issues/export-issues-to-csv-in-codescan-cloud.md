# Export issues to CSV in CodeScan Cloud

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

You can export issues as CSV files from CodeScan. Exporting issues to CSV enables you and your team to export all the data collected from issues into a `comma-separated values (CSV)` file, which stores tabular data in plain text. You can narrow down which issues to export using the filters, along with the severities of the issues.

### Use Cases <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

The following are some of the use cases for exporting issues as CSV files:

* Create diagrams, graphs, and charts from the CSV data.
* Present the data in any other format for auditing or sharing reasons.
* Import the issues elsewhere to a system outside of CodeScan.
* Use the long-term data to gather relevant feedback given in the issues, and improve your product based on real metrics.
