We have grouped risks under four key Security Goals:

**Goal 1: Establish Secure Access & Identity**

Ensuring only authorized users access Salesforce, their identities are verified, and highly privileged access is governed.

**Goal 2: Harden Application & Session Security**

Protecting the Salesforce application from common web vulnerabilities, ensuring secure communication, and maintaining user session integrity.

**Goal 3: Safeguard Data & Control Exposure**

Protecting data confidentiality and integrity by managing sharing settings, controlling access to sensitive information, and limiting guest user access.

**Goal 4: Ensure Foundational Platform Integrity**

Maintaining the core security of the Salesforce platform via valid configurations for certificates, encryption, and secure external connections.

Users can see their progress towards achieving each Goal and remediate the associated risks accordingly.&#x20;

2. Custom Permission Explorer queries can be saved

Just give your query a name and definitive description, and it will be saved for your future revisits:
