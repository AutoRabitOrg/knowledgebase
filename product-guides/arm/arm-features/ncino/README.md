### Super Admin roles in Account Activation and Categorization (Partner/Customer) <a href="#super-admin-roles-in-account-activation-and-categorization-partnercustomer" id="super-admin-roles-in-account-activation-and-categorization-partnercustomer"></a>

The Super Administrator will have the capability of marking an account as either partner/customer with the user-specific prefix. The accounts marked as a partner will be able to create Standard/ Community templates whereas customer accounts are restricted to creating only community templates.

Simply, login to the AutoRABIT account using the Super Admin credentials and go to the **My Account** section. Under the **Subscription Details**, assign the user as an **nCino Partner** to allow them to create Standard/Community Templates. If not assigned, the user will be treated as a customer account and are restricted to creating only Community templates.
