# Security Information and Event Management

### Introduction to SIEM

As more companies and organizations move their operations digitally, the importance of strong cybersecurity tools has grown. For example, many cyber attackers are actively looking for vulnerable systems against which to launch attacks. As a result, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) products have become an important part of detecting and preventing cyberattacks.

SIEM events convert log entries and events from security systems into actionable data using rules and statistical correlations. This data will aid security teams in detecting threats in real time, managing incident response, conducting forensic investigations into previous security incidents, and preparing compliance audits.
