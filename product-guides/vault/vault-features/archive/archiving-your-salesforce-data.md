# Archiving Your Salesforce Data

1. Log in to your Vault account.
2.  Go to the **Setup** module.\

3.  Locate the Salesforce Org for which the data has to be archived. You can use the **Search** filter to easily find the required Salesforce Org.

4. Navigate to the **Configs** tab.
5.  Click on **Add Archive Config**. This will allow you to view all the components available in your Salesforce Org and choose the components for which you want to define the archive policy.

6.  Select the components that you need to archive on the next screen.

7.  Using **Filters,** you can define the criteria for which the records will get fetched. For example, you can define criteria to fetch **AccountBrand** records that are older than _1,000 days_ and _field Id_ is not empty.\


    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>AccountBrand-Filter</p></figcaption></figure>

Validate your query to see whether the criteria set is correct and view the number of records that will be fetched. You can even set the record count limit for your data being fetched. Click on **Apply** to set the criteria and close the Filter dialog box. To easily identify the objects for which the filter is applied, the filter icon is highlighted.

8.  The **Hierarchy** option will allow you to view all the corresponding child objects for your selected object. These child objects will also get archived once you archive their parent object. Such a hierarchy schema view can be seen using the **Hierarchy** option.

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Hierarchy</p></figcaption></figure>

    You may notice in the schema view that some of the objects are auto-selected by default and cannot be unchecked. These are the child objects of its parent object, which will be deleted if the parent object is selected for archival per policy. However, for other objects that are related to the selected object in some other way, you may have the option to choose them manually for archival. Visit the Mandatory Child Archival page for more information.

9.  Once done, click **Save** to close the hierarchy-schema screen. Similar to **filter** criteria addition, the hierarchy icon gets highlighted corresponding to the object for which hierarchy is selected.\

10. Click **Next.** On the next screen, do the following:
    * Give the process a **name**.
    * Select the **email notification** checkbox to receive an email notification whenever the objects are getting deleted from your Salesforce Org. If unchecked, data will be automatically deleted without any prior notification.
    * Select the date and time interval for the archive process to run under the **Schedule Archive** section. You can set the policy to run either daily, weekly, monthly, or input any duration manually.
    * You can specify till what time period you want to retain the archived data under the **Archive retention period** section.
    * Specify the **batch size** for components to retrieve records. 10K is the max batch size that you can set per batch. This option is useful in running large jobs that would exceed normal processing limits. As per the Salesforce governor limit, you can deploy or retrieve up to 10,000 files at once or a max size of 40MB. Using Batch Size, you can process records in batches to stay within platform limits. If you have a lot of records, processing records through batches are your best solution.
    *   **Enable serial mode for Bulk API:** Serial mode processes batch one at a time, however, it can increase the processing time for a load.

        <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1614).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Enable serial mode for bulk API</p></figcaption></figure>
11. Click **Save Config**.
12. A summary of all the objects, filters, and criteria selected or applied will get displayed before your archive policy gets configured. Click **Save**.

    <figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1620).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Save Config Details</p></figcaption></figure>
13. Now go to the **Archive** tab.
14. Select your [**Salesforce Org**](../../../arm/arm-administration/registration/salesforce-org/) for which you configured the archive recently.&#x20;
15. Select the **Environment**.
16. Select the archive configured recently under **Configurations** drop-down field.

18. To run on-demand archive before the scheduled archive set, use **Archive Now** button.
19. On the **Start Archive** screen, the label name gets auto-populated, however, you have the option to edit the label name and enter the label you desire.
20. &#x20;Select your configuration and click **Archive**.

## Limitations

* Inconsistent File Download During GDPR Requests: When a GDPR request is initiated within an organization, file downloads may behave inconsistently. This issue will be resolved in the upcoming release.
* File Download Issues with Special Characters in File Names: Files with special characters in their names may not function properly in certain environments, particularly on macOS. This issue will be addressed in the upcoming release.
