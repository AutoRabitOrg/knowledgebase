## Error message: Validation checking fails for your repository

Users may encounter this error message when a Merge is failed. This occurs when repository credentials are expired or have been modified and not updated in ARM.&#x20;

1. Navigate to **Admin > VC repos**, select your repository, and perform a test connection. Please verify your repository credentials are not expired or modified.
2. Re-run the CI job after you confirm that the repository connection is successful.
