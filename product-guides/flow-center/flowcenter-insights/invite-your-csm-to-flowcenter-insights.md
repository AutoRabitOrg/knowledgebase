# Invite your CSM to FlowCenter Insights

**Inviting your CSM to FlowCenter Insights**&#x20;

Admin users can now create temporary users designed to allow your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to have limited access to Insights. Use this to collaborate with them for an upcoming quarterly business review or to discuss improvements in your way of working.&#x20;

To create a temporary user, click on User Management > Create User and select AutoRABIT Employee Guest. Users with this role have the following limitations:&#x20;

* They cannot edit or delete your dashboards; they can only create their own.
* They cannot access the User Management area.&#x20;
* They do not see the Export button in any widgets.&#x20;
* They expire after a user-defined period of time.&#x20;

You must use an autorabit.com email address. The username (or login Id) will be auto populated and will include your tenant Id. Once you click Save, your CSM will receive an email notification with their login details. &#x20;

You can always deactive the user before their access period expires by clicking the Deactivate button&#x20;

All dashboard-related activities (create, edit, delete) for these users are tracked in the audit log right below their user detail page.
