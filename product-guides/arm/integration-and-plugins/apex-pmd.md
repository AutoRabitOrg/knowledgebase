# Apex PMD

### What is PMD?  <a href="#what-is-pmd" id="what-is-pmd"></a>

PMD stands for Programming Mistake Detector. It is a source code analyzer that finds common mistakes in your code, like unused variables, if-else statements without braces, naming conventions of methods, SOQL in loops, and many more. It also includes CPD (for Copy/Paste Detector), which finds duplicate code in your files and makes you aware of improvements to make your code reusable.

Supported Version: ApexPMD upgraded to the latest 6.49 version.

3. Go to the **Plugins** section.
4. Click on the **ApexPMD** checkbox under **Static Code Analysis**.
5. If you do have separate Apex PMD rules that you would like to carry out in AutoRABIT, you can upload the same. Click **Browse** to search for the file in your local machine. Usually, the file is in **XML** format. Once done, click **Upload**.
6. If the user has not uploaded any rules file, AutoRABIT will use the default Apex PMD rules file. However, you can update some of the fields in it.&#x20;
7. Download the default rule set in your local machine using the link as shown below.

6. AutoRABIT allows you to set the criteria for running the ApexPMD SCA tool. This means running for all the apex classes or stating the period from when it will run. Also, you can set the priority, which means if the priority set is not achieved, the current build is unstable. This helps us in reporting the code quality of the developer team.
7. Fill in the remaining fields as per your requirements and click on **Save**.
8. Once the build is triggered for your CI Job, the SCA report can be found under the **Build Details** section on the **CI Job Result** page.
