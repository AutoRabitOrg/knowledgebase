# Licenses

The **License and Subscription Tracking** feature in Vault serves as a centralized reference point for managing and monitoring all license and subscription details within the application. By consolidating this information into a single location, Vault ensures that administrators and stakeholders have clear visibility into usage, entitlements, and subscription timelines. This feature streamlines oversight, reduces the risk of missed renewals, and provides an efficient way to stay compliant with organizational and contractual requirements.
