# On-Premises Releases



{% hint style="info" %}
We recognize that ourself-hosted customers have different requirements pertaining to SonarQube versions.  As such, CodeScan is committed to supporting a wide spectrum of versions to accommodate this variance.

As SonarQube continues to release new versions consistently every 2 -3 months, we have decided to offer 2 versions of CodeScan self-hosted to ensure ongoing compatibility.

**Please note that our July 2024 release (24.0.8) fully supports SQ 9.9 LTA as well SQ 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2**

**For customers that intend to run on these earlier versions of SonarQube**, we welcome you to upgrade to our latest release – CodeScan Self-Hosted Tiger Edition (24.0.9).This release is generally available as of Sep 05 and is compatible with SQ 9.9 LTA and SQ 10.0 – 10.3.

**For customers that intend to run on newer versions of SonarQube**, we welcome you to upgrade to our latest release – CodeScan Self-Hosted Eagle Edition (24.1.0).This release is generally available as of Aug 28 and is compatible with SQ 10.1– 10.6.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Please see our corresponding compatibility matrix for guidance.

&#x20;

Please note that we intend to make as much feature parity with the Tiger and Eagle editions as possible; however, there will be slight variances in these editions.  Please refer to the corresponding release notes for complete documentation of features.

&#x20;

Also, we are anticipating 10.7 to be released in September 2024, andhave planned support for 10.7 in Nov 2024.  Starting with the 10.7 rollout, we intend to have support for the latest versions of SonarQube approximately 8 weeks after their release date.  Each version will be supported for 12 months.
