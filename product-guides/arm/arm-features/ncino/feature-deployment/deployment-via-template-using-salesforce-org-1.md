3. The following fields are available on the screen to from:
   1. **Label name:** Input label name of the deployment here
   2. **Description:** Enter a description that suits the deployment
   3. **Source ORG:** Select the source ORG
   4. **Feature Type:** Select the feature type from the available list. Following are the available values
      1. Standard
      2. Community
   5. **Feature:** Select the required feature&#x20;
   6. Version: Select the version based on the feature selection.
4. On entering all the details, click on the next to continue to the "Destination" screen

5. Enable "Deploy To" and "Commit To" options on the destination screen. To deploy into a salesforce org, select the **Deploy To** checkbox and choose your **Destination Org**. To commit to a branch, select the **Commit To** box, enter your **Repository/Branch** details, and **comment** (if any).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note**: For commits, the features will get committed to the default location in your version control branch. By default, the location is set to the dataset.
{% endhint %}

6. The following options can be observed on the data selected for deployment or commiting the data
   1. Object: The object selected
   2. ExternalId mappings:&#x20;
   3. Sorting Criteria (only if the 'Commit to' checkbox is selected)
   4. Applied Filters
7.  ExternalId Mappings:

    1. This external ID can be used in place of a related record's Salesforce record ID to relate or associate records to each other as you process an Upsert operation. For example, if **Object B** has a lookup field to another **Object A,** you can use the values in a field marked as an External ID on **Object A** to relate the two (**Object B** to **Object A** records).
       1. **Source**: Select your source field whose values will be populated in the destination External Id field.
       2. **Destination**: Select the required field from the destination org whose values will remain unique for all the records.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important Note:** (ExternalIdMappings):

1. Since the source for Deployment via **Template** or **Version Control** is a CSV file rather than a Salesforce Org, all fields, regardless of the External ID supported, will be fetched and displayed in the **Source** column. However, the relevant fields will be shown under the Destination column since the target org is a salesforce org.
2. AutoRABIT External ID fields are not supported for the **Upsert** operation.
{% endhint %}

8. Sorting Criteria: This new feature is useful for sorting the fields of nCino objects while committing. Based on the sorting order set, the record order in the JSON files will get fetched. There is a provision to input a default sorting order that can be changed. **XXXXX\_lookupkey\_\_c** is the most preferred field for sorting, and that would be the default field. If this field is not present, the **Name** for _custom settings_ and **Id** for _non-custom settings_ would be selected.

9. **Applied filters**: Such filters will be displayed here if any filter is applied to the objects. You can edit the already applied filter (if required) using **Edit Filter.**

10. After completing the required selections in the "Destination" section, click on "Next" to continue.
11. **Job settings:** This section provides multiple deployment options to help you configure how changes are pushed to the destination org. You can select from various deployment criteria to tailor the process before initiating deployment.

12. &#x20;**Deployment Filters**
    1. **Disable Workflow Rules:** This option will deactivate the workflow rules associated with objects part of the deployment
    2. **Use Bulk API (Batch API will be used if the option is not enabled):** You can transfer bulk records in a go from the source and destination org
    3. **Use UTF-8 file encoding for file read and write operations:** Use UTF-8 as the internal representation of strings. Text is transcoded from the local encoding to UTF-8 when data is written to or read from a file. UTF-8 must be enabled if your data exclusively contains English alphabets. UTF-8 must be disabled if your data contains non-English alphabets. UTF-8 should be enabled by default in accordance with Salesforce.
    4. **Automap User/Owner Data**: Enabling this ensures that the user data will be compared between the two environments and will be mapped based on the value before the "@" symbol in the email. On finding the matches, the same user name value will be populated into the fields in the destination. If the user data is sent empty, the user value will be populated with the user registered with our application.
    5. **Disable Validation Rules:** This option will deactivate the validation rules associated with objects part of the deployment
    6. **Insert/update with Null Values:** This will either insert or update record field values with null in the destination org (if the value is null in the source org)
    7. **Enable Rollback**: Enabling this ensures that the user can rollback the deployment to the previous state before the deployment is initiated.
13. **Preview**: All the configurations made during the deployment creation can be observed here, with different deployment options

13. Based on your destination selection, you will have different deployment buttons to choose from:
    1. **Create Dataset:** Create a dataset from your Salesforce Org
    2. **Create Dataset Commit & Deploy:** Create a dataset and proceed for both commit and deployment.
14. Clicking on ether of the deployment options available above, you will be redirected to the "Deployment History" page.
