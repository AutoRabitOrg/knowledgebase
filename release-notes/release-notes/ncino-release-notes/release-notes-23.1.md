**September 2023**\
**Version 23.1 – Streamlined CI/CD and Enhanced Control**

We're thrilled to introduce a series of exciting enhancements to elevate your nCino experience. Get ready for:

**1. Precision Deployment:** Define your baseline revisions and effortlessly trigger builds for new revisions, enabling delta deployments. Package multiple commit revisions together for swift Record-Based Configuration (RBC) deployments.

**2. Multi-Sandbox Mastery:** Seamlessly deploy nCino CI builds to multiple target sandboxes, with the flexibility to choose up to 5 organizations per job. Say goodbye to redundant job creations for the same deployment across multiple Orgs.

**3. Effortless Job Management:** Our revamped CI job flow guides you directly to the ‘Job List’ page, streamlining your experience. A simple ‘Run’ button on this page empowers you to initiate jobs effortlessly.

**4. Rollback Assurance:** Take control of your nCino RBC deployments with our rollback feature. Capture snapshots before deployment and confidently revert your Org to its prior state if needed.

**5. Access + Validation:** We've renamed 'Applied Mappings' to 'External ID Mapping' for clarity. Plus, enjoy peace of mind with automated validation, ensuring your access to objects and essential external ID fields.

**6. Post-Deployment Insights:** Keep a finger on the pulse of post-deployment activities. The ‘Post Deploy Details' section provides consolidated updates for multiple Orgs. Dive deeper with 'View Details’ to explore Orgs and their records effortlessly.
