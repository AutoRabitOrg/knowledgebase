# Replicate

Vault streamlines what is normally an error-prone process of seeding test data into sandboxes and testing the scripts, code, rules, and reports. Additionally, sensitive production data can be masked for data protection and compliance purposes during test procedures.

1. Easily select data sets for testing scripts, code, rules, and reports.
2. Easily seed test data for your sandbox.
3. Automatically detect data object relationships.
4. Apply masking to protect production data during the test.
