# What is a Subscription Code?

A subscription code is an identifier for your CodeScan self-hosted license. It is a way to share download access with the necessary resources without providing your full [CodeScan License Key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-codescan-license-key).

When downloading [CodeScan plugins](https://www.codescan.io/products/editor-plugins/), you are required to fill in the below details:

* Enter your name
* Enter your email address
* Enter the subscription code or, your [CodeScan license key](https://knowledgebase.autorabit.com/codescan/docs/what-is-a-codescan-license-key)
* Accept the CodeScan [Terms of Service](https://www.codescan.io/tos/self-hosted/)\
